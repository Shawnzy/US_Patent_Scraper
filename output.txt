The parachute data recorder system may further include a second accelerometer, one of the accelerometers being a low-g accelerometer and the other being a high-g accelerometer. The initiation of recording can be started by stress or strain inducement from parachute deployment.This is a nonprovisional application claiming priority from U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/906,580, filed on Nov. 20, 2013, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein.This invention was made with government support under Contract No. W91CRB-11-C-0021, Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center, U.S. Army Research Development and Engineering Command. The government has certain rights in the invention.This invention relates to a system end device for recording data related to parachute training, testing, and evaluation, and in particular, to a system and device including motion-based sensors and other equipment capable of monitoring, recording and analyzing 3-axis acceleration, pressure, temperature, 3-axis angular velocity and Global Positioning System (GPS) location.For air drop operations, both personal and cargo, tracking performance and usage data is necessary for routine maintenance and training, as well as incident investigations. Currently, this data tracking, which is limited to parachute usage and packing frequency, is handled by manually recording usage information in logbooks and used to determine maintenance and repacking schedules. Furthermore, these manually recorded data are prone to human error and are labor intensive. Of course, if parachute systems are left in service too long, this increases the safety risk. For incident investigations, only usage data and eye witness accounts are available. For example, information relating to parachute performance such as the opening shock force, descent rate, etc., can be very valuable especially in instances resulting in a parachute failure, and wherein if injury or a fatality results. Heretofore, there has been no consistent means of data collection whereby parameters such as deployment time, location, altitude, and opening shock force can be made available. If this data collection management system could be automated, it would be more efficient, more accurate and more comprehensive.Therefore, an object of the invention is to provide an innovative Parachute Data Recorder (PDR) system. It is also an object of the invention to provide an automatic data recording device whereby both routine performance and usage parameters critical to an accident investigation can be reliably collected upon parachute deployment. Another object of the invention is that the PDR be portable, network ready, sensor rich, and capable of recording and managing data for parachuting applications. It is a further object of the invention that the device for the PDR system is designed as a retro-fit for attachment to personnel and/or cargo being parachuted and have a relatively small, lightweight, and low-power design that would allow for easy integration into existing parachute systems without altering safety characteristics. A further object of the invention that the air drop system's main components, harnessing container should serve as the database key to allow for flexibility between reserve and main parachutes.A further object of the invention that data recording may be initiated upon parachute deployment by means of stress/strain inducement and capture time, location, altitude, and opening shock. This further object depends on pressure sensing technology that can be used to record altitude, while integration with GPS technology can record both location and provide a real-time stamp for data logging. Additionally, the system may provide an interface to allow the parachute rigger to record packing information including a method to record the parachute rigger's identification (i.e., signature via smart card technology or other electronic means). A further object is that the system could maintain the current state of the art and capture all current logbook information for the life of the parachute system as well as parachute performance data.Another object of the invention is that the system be compatible with both static line and military free-fall parachute systems and that information for each jump be capable of being broken down into primary and secondary needs. Primary needs represent data collected without significant modifications to the parachute system, which for a static line include: parachute packed by and date and serial number; reserve packed by and date and serial number; jumper identification; aircraft type; date of jump; DZ location; parachute harness type; equipment configuration; jumper weight; and jump master inspection by. Secondary needs represent data collection requiring additional equipment development to be attached to the parachute system or jumper, which for a static line include: opening shock profile; rate of descent profile; and altitude.The free-fall primary needs include: altitude at exit-user input; altitude at opening-user input; main parachute type and serial number; reserve parachute type and serial number; parachute harness type and serial number; automatic activation device type and serial number; oxygen equipment type and serial number; parachute packed by and date; reserve packed by and date; jumper identification; aircraft type; aircraft speed-user input; date of jump; DZ location; equipment configuration; altimeter type and setting; and jump master inspection by.

This allows clear tracking of inventory and uses of the equipment for reliable analysis and life usage calculations. It is a further object of the invention to link the scanned items to a database including factory recall alerts or maintenance action requests to easily identify which equipment has been recalled or is in need of maintenance. An additional object of the invention is that the database include alerts to the rigger when certain components have exceed their design specifications, for instance, such as temperature, excessive shock, or exceeded the maximum number of jumps. It is a further object of the invention that the PDR may be able to incorporate health monitoring features, such as pulse, blood pressure, temperature, etc., which may be maintained in a database to monitor health parameters and identify potential health issues of the jumpers.In one embodiment of the invention, a parachute data recorder system is provided that includes a housing, the housing having a seal for resistance to moisture and environmental impact; a plurality of sensors mounted in the housing, including an accelerometer, an altimeter, a gyrometer, and a GPS; a microprocessor mounted in the housing for recording and processing data from the sensors; a wireless connection unit mounted in the housing for transmitting data in the microprocessor; and an electronic connection port.The parachute data recorder system may further include a second accelerometer, one of the accelerometers being a low-g accelerometer and the other being a high-g accelerometer.

Although the drawings represent embodiments of the present invention, the drawings are not necessarily to scale and certain features may be exaggerated in order to better illustrate and explain the present invention. The exemplification set out herein illustrates embodiments of the invention, and such exemplifications are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any manner.For the purpose of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings, which are described below. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended. The invention includes any alterations and further modifications in the illustrated devices and described methods and further applications of the principles of the invention, which would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates.A parachute data recorder system and device is provided having a relatively small size and low power consumption that can be readily integrated into existing parachute systems without altering their safety characteristics.Now referring to FIG. 1, one embodiment of a Parachute Data Analyzer (PDA) device is shown, generally indicated as 10. PDA device 10 includes a case or housing 12, a display 14, and a plurality of control buttons, generally indicated as 16. The PDA can be used to receive downloaded data from a PDR and analyze/display the data.Now referring to FIGS. 2-3, one embodiment of the packaging design for a PDR device is shown, generally indicated as 110. PDR device 110 includes a case or housing 112, a main control button 116, and apertures with threaded fasteners 118 for securely holding case 112, which may be supplied with front and back covers, together.Now referring to FIGS. 4-7, an alternate embodiment PDR device is shown, generally indicated as 210. PDR device 210 includes a case or housing 212, a main control button 216, and a plurality of apertures with threaded fasteners 218, which may be used to hold front and rear covers making up case 212, together. Device 210 also includes an LED light 220, and a bottom aperture or tie off point 222. A parachute chord may be tied and/or weaved through the tie off points for added security of the device. As best shown in FIG. 5, some threaded fasteners may be left out of apertures 218 to provide additional tie off points 218a along the sides of case 212. The embodiment of PDR device 210 shown in FIG. 5 includes four side tie off points 218a. Case 212 should be manufactured from a material having sufficient strength, lightness of weight and that is compatible with the electronics and wireless systems contained therein. Case 212 may be made from Nylon 6.It should be appreciated that preferably PDR device 210 is water tight and appropriate sealing means may be employed. Referring to FIGS. 6 and 7, an access door 224 may also be provided in case 210. The access door may be removed by removing an applicable threaded fastener 218. When access door 224 is removed, (as best shown in FIG. 7), a USB port 226 is exposed. It should be appreciated that an appropriate seal may be used around access door 224 to provide a water tight compartment in which USB port 226 is located.Now referring to FIGS. 8-20, yet another alternate embodiment PDR is shown, generally indicated as 310. As with PDR device embodiments 110 and 210, PDR device 310 includes a case or housing 312, a main control button 316 and a plurality of apertures with threaded fasteners 318 for securely holding case 312 together, which includes a front cover 312a and a rear cover 312b (FIG. 15). PDR device 310 also includes an LED 320 and a lower aperture or tie off point 322. Also, as with PDR device 210, PDR device 310 may include side tie off points 318a where threaded fasteners may be omitted (as best shown in FIG. 9).As indicated that it is desirous to maintain the PDR devices with as low a profile as possible. Accordingly, housing 312 has as low a profile while still meeting specifications. Housing 312 includes two slightly higher areas than the remainder of the housing. One is a localized protrusion or protruding area 324a on front cover 312a, and the other protrusion or protruding area 324b is in rear cover 312b. Referring to FIG. 20, protrusions 324a and 324b surround an antenna 326 and extend outwardly beyond the remainder of case 312 to provide pocketed areas 328a and 328b around antenna 326 to ensure that the enclosure is at least 0.25 inches away from any area in the case for proper functionality. Structural integrity of case 312 is maintained in protrusions 324a and 324b. In one embodiment of a prototype produced in accordance with the design of PDR device 310, the maximum length of the device was 4.9 inches, the maximum width was 2.91 inches, and the height was a maximum of 0.8 inches.As it is desirable that device 310 maintain water tightness to a depth of five meters for duration of at least 30 minutes, a seal 329 is provided (FIGS. 11 and 12) that includes a V-shaped tongue 330 extending from front cover 312a, which is received in a square groove 332 in rear cover 312b. Groove 332 may be filled with a sealant 334, such as RTV silicon, whereby the front cover 312a and rear cover 312b are pressed together and sealed and ultimately screwed down tight using apertures and fasteners 318 to provide a suitable seal. Seal 329 makes a smooth path around the flat plane of the enclosure (FIGS. 11 and 12). It should be noted, that the groove is also formed around a USB opening to ensure sealing in that area as well. It is not necessary to seal the screws as they are located to the exterior of seal 329 and do not affect the internal waterproof integrity except by firmly securing the two halves together.It should be appreciated that a material such as Nylon 6 for construction of housing 312 assures that the housing is EMI/RF transparent and also provides adequate strength while maintaining transparency for wireless devices and antennae to function properly. It was found that no EMI shielding was required nor EMI paint on the inside of the enclosure to maintain the wireless transparency.Covers 212a and 212b may be attached with an internal ball and chain system (not shown) with a revolving mount to allow the cover to be screwed together and apart without binding the chain. This would assure that the covers do not become lost or separated from one another when unscrewed but still allows adequate access to an internal USB connector. A prototype of the case with the aforementioned design met testing requirements in accordance with the water tightness criteria to a depth of five meters for a duration of at least 30 minutes.Referring now to FIG. 16, a close up enlarged view of an aperture and threaded fastener 318 is shown. Securement of housing 312 (i.e., front cover 312a and rear cover 312b) is achieved through the bonding of the RTV silicon in seal 329 along with the threaded fasteners/apertures 318. For corrosion resistance, military spec type stainless steel screws may be used, whereby the screws mate with a metal insert 336, which is screwed into rear cover 312b, This design is found to be vibration-resistant.Referring now to FIGS. 15 and 21, electronics, which are contained on a printed circuit board, generally indicated as 338, are screwed to the nylon case 312, and neoprene padding is placed under the battery and voids between electronics and the inside of the enclosure where possible, as best shown in FIG. 17. Furthermore, all parts have nylon support tabs internally to hold circuit board 338 and the battery and position under high vibration and g conditions.A USB connector 340 (FIG. 13) is provided beneath a sealed end cap 342. USB connector 340 is of the internal female type, but it should be noted that a slim overmolded male USB cable could be utilized to allow the cable to fit inside the open space 344 (FIG. 13) beneath end cap 342 and that mates with the internal USB female connector 340.Coupled with main control button 316, which is a flexible switch cover, is a tactile switch 346 (FIGS. 15, 21, and 22). Main control button 316 allows the switch to be pressed while maintaining its tactile feel. This pass through is made to maintain the low profile so that the switch is not accidentally depressed while stored. The pass through is made to be pressed similar to a grommet and then additionally sealed with RTV silicon so as to maintain the waterproof integrity (see FIG. 19). Additionally, a light pipe 348 (see FIG. 18) is provided to allow the internal LED 320 to be viewed externally while maintaining a water tight seal. The light pipe is pressed into the front cover 312a of case 312 and sealed around a perimeter with RTV silicon or other suitable sealant to ensure the integrity of the seal.The PDR system of the subject invention includes a web-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) application as well as one or more of the above hardware devices. The system runs a firmware in the PDR hardware to provide real-time control of sensors, communications, power management, and user interface. The PDR hardware is composed of several subsystems including power management, sensors, Wi-Fi, and 4 GB flash storage.The PDR device is a rugged, network-ready, ultra-low power embedded device that is used to collect, store and transfer motion-based sensing data. Referring now to FIG. 24 (see also FIGS. 21-23), a hardware block diagram is indicated, generally as 400. The hardware is composed of several subsystems including: power management 401, sensors, Wi-Fi 403 and 4 GB flash storage 405. A microprocessor 402 is provided and may be based on the TI MSP430x family, which is an ultra-low power processor for multimedia applications. The PDR devices are equipped with several motion-based sensors including: 3-axis accelerometers 404a, 404b, 3-axis gyrometer 406, an altimeter 408 and GPS 410. Data is time-stamped and stored in real-time to removable flash 405, which can be access via USB 340 or Wi-Fi 403. The device may be powered by a battery and/or USB 412. A real-time clock 414 is also provided (FIG. 23). The device is also highly configurable, which can be modified to program power consumption, sensors, rates, calibration and network services. Sensors can be disabled or set at different sample rates to meet a large range of power requirements for different applications. Each sensor is a self-contained, mixed-signal, low-power system-on-chip (SOC) that supports detection events, programmability and high resolution data.The web-based GUI is a cross-platform Java application that is supported on most handheld devices and personal computers. The GUI provides an easy interface to manage users and equipment (PDR devices, parachutes, etc.), schedule parachute jump sessions for a group of users (which may or may not have PDR devices installed on their equipment), and configure PDR devices (USB or WiFi). User and performance data is stored in a SQL database, which can be accessed over a local area network (or the Internet if the user chooses to do so) for further analysis. It should further be appreciated that the PDR device and system can include a scanner for scanning different components of the parachute system, such the riser, parachute canopy, oxygen, and altimeter. Each of the components has an associated ID number that can be tracked by the PDR and wherein a software package is provided to maintain a database for each component and further including information relating to the jumper, the rigger, etc. The software can be made to be accessible on-line and further includes the ability to link scanned items to a database that can provide factory recall alerts or maintenance action requests. This would alert the jumper or the rigger that there has been a factory recall or maintenance request for one of the parachute system components for addressing the same. Additionally, it should be appreciated that the database is equipped with the ability to present red flags or alerts to the rigger and/or jumper when certain components have exceed their design specifications or are the subject of a recall alert or maintenance request. As such, the database can provide an alert when the operational temperature of the parachute or equipment has been exceeded, the equipment has received excessive shock, or if the equipment has exceeded the maximum number of jumps recommended. It should further be appreciated that the PDR may be used as a health monitoring device to monitor such things including but not limited to pulse rate, blood pressure, and body temperature.In one embodiment, the PDR hardware uses the Texas Instruments MSP430x ultra-low power microprocessor 402 as its main controller. The processor offers numerous advantages such as five low-power modes, numerous bus interfaces (SPI, UART, etc.), 12-bit analog-to-digital converters, 100 kB of internal Flash and 8 KB of RAM. Resources (memory and processing) are limited, so USB, Wi-Fi or recording cannot be enabled simultaneously.The hardware consists of several motion-based digital sensors including the altimeter 408, the gyrometer 406, GPS module with integrated antenna 410, and the two accelerometers (low/high g-range) 404a, 404b. To reduce power consumption, the sensors are only powered and enabled when the device is in the recording mode. Micro-SD FAT16 file system 405 holds up to 4 GB and is supported to store configuration, firmware, and sensor log files, which are accessible via Wi-Fi 403 and USB 340 services. The USB 340 service is based on the mass-storage device driver class (MSC), which provides a user-friendly environment to browse the file system. The Wi-Fi module 403 may be from Redpine Signals, Inc. and is a self-contained Wi-Fi that includes an integrated MAC, baseband processor, RF transceiver, and power amplifier. The module is a complete end-to-end solution for ultra-low power WLAN applications such as data streaming, file transfer protocol (FTP) and other network services.Now referring to FIGS. 15, and 21-22, in one embodiment the hardware includes a four-layer printed circuit board (PCB) 350 which may have a configuration size of 54.4×60.2×10.9 mm. Schematics of the PDR hardware are shown in FIGS. 25-29. For PDR device 310, PCB 350 and battery 412, which may be of a lithium-ion type are properly secured and isolated to avoid measurement noise caused by vibrations. As discussed previously, enclosure material may be made from Nylon 6 fibers, which have a high tensile strength and elasticity. The front cover 312a of case 312 includes LED 220 for status indication, the main push button control 316, and USB port 340 which is made water tight with sealed end cap 342. Additionally, the axis orientation is preferably permanently labeled on the front cover of the enclosure (not shown).As best shown in FIGS. 15 and 21, PCB 350 is secured to case 312, and in particular, to bottom cover 312b using two threaded fasteners 354.The PDR user operations are based on main button 316, bi-color status LED 32 and mini-USB connector 340. Main button 316 is used to power the device by pressing and holding the button for a duration of greater than 2 seconds. When powered, the recording service 32 is enabled or disabled by pressing main button 316 and quickly releasing. The duration of the button press for recording mode is user-defined in the configuration file and cannot exceed 2 seconds. The default is set to 750 milliseconds.To enable USB or Wi-Fi services, device 316 must be in the idle mode and the device must be connected to a USB source. If the source is a USB host (such as a PC), the USB mass-storage interface is enabled, and the device's file system is accessible from the USB host. If the USB is connected to a 5 volt-powered source instead of a USB host, then Wi-Fi is enabled, which allows access point scanning and the file transfer network protocol (FTP).The following Table 1 summarizes the user operations for PDR device 310:

Status LED 320 provides up to four unique states including: IDLE Status (Solid Green): The device is ready and set to a low-power mode (<30 mW); Recording Status (Blinking Green): The device enables all sensors and continuously records sensor data to removable flash (FAT16 file system 405); Busy Status (Solid Orange): The device is busy performing an operation (Wi-Fi, USB, configuration, etc.). (Note: It is recommended that the user waits until the device enters the idle mode before performing the next operation); and Unrecoverable System Error (Solid Red): The device's firmware detected a hardware or software error and requires power cycling. Device and application settings can be modified in the configuration file to determine the cause.A FAT16 file system is organized on 4 GB flash 405 via a micro-SD card. The file system includes the PDR configuration file, a firmware folder and sensor data files. The directory structure is described in Table 2.


The sensor data files (SENSOR.BIN) are organized by date (YYYYMMDD) and instance (i.e., SESS_0, SESS_1, . . . , SESS_N). The date and time when the binary log file is created provides an approximate time when the recording sessions started. All sampled data are time-stamped in seconds (millisecond accuracy) relative to midnight for a given day.
Power management module (PMM) 401 is based on a standard chipset for power regulation, distribution, monitoring and battery recharging. As shown in FIG. 30, power is supplied by a powered USB device 412b or a lithium-ion battery 412a, which is regulated to an analog 416a and digital 3.3 v 416b (<800 mA) supply bus. The power management module 401 also includes a power controller 417 and power monitor 419. Three types of power monitoring signals are supplied to the microprocessor 402: power on reset (POR), battery charging (CHRG) and VCC voltage monitor. A power regulator 418 provides the POR signal, which asserts if the desired output power is out-of-range by 8%. The CHRG signal determines if the battery is charging (i.e., USB attached), and the VMON signal assert when VCC drops below 2.8 v. By default, these monitoring signals are not installed on the PCB, and are used for debugging purposes.PDR device 316 supports multiple power modes based as shown below in Table 3 on enabled sensors and data rates. Power consumption can easily be customized per application by setting up the configuration file located on the device's file system.

The PDR hardware supports two real-time clocks (RTC) 414 to maintain the current date and time for time-of-day time-stamping. The MSP430x processor 402 does not support an RTC battery backup pin, so the date and time is maintained on an external RTC (RV-2123). During firmware initialization the date and time is read from the external RTC, which is used to set the internal RTC 414 for fast access times while recording. Times-tamping sensor data is accomplished by reporting the number of second's relative from midnight with microsecond accuracy. This is accomplished by synchronizing a hardware timer with the internal RTC 414.The PDR hardware supports five integrated sensors on a single SPI bus: tri-axis gyrometer 406, tri-axis low-g accelerometer 404a, tri-axis high-g accelerometer 404b, altimeter 408, and GPS 410 with integrated antenna. Each sensor is programmable (rates, filtering, etc.) and offers unique features such as low-power detection modes (e.g., free-fall). A summary of each sensor's specification used in the prototype PDR device 310 is listed in Table 4. More detailed information of these sensors is provided below.

The combined data throughput is limited by the rate of processor 402 (25 MHz) and the SPI interface (12.5 Mb/s), which has a maximum flash 512-byte write-access rate of 100 kB/s. The effective data rate is much less due to the overheads for servicing sensor (data) interrupts. The maximum effective sensor data rate is defined as 800 Hz (if supported) when all sensors are enabled. At maximum capacity dropped samples are likely due to CPU processing load.One suitable accelerometer is the ADXL345 accelerometer from Analog Devices which is an ultra-low power, factory calibrated, 3-axis accelerometer with high resolution (13-bit) and a measurement range up to ±16 g. The PDR hardware consists of two accelerometers 404a,b, which are configured for two different g-ranges: ±4 g and ±16 g. The design also includes two accelerometers 404a,b to provide additional hardware detectors (total of 4) for ultra-low power event triggering (e.g., free-fall and bi-threshold detection). In future firmware versions, the low-g acceleration is expected to be used as a detector to provide time-stamped event markers. The specifications for the ADXL345 are defined in Table 5.

One suitable altimeter 408 is the LPS331AP altimeter from STMicroelectronics, which is an ultra-low power, factory calibrated pressure and temperature sensor that includes a SPI/IC digital interface, and integrated bi-threshold detector. Table 6 shows a brief summary of the device's hardware specification.

One suitable gyrometer 406 is the L3GD20 gyrometer from STMicroelectronics, which is a low-power, factory calibrated, 3-axis angular rate sensor that includes a SPI/IC digital interface. The sensor is a mixed-signal integrated circuit that includes numerous features such as filtering, power modes, signal detection and temperature output. The PDR device hard-codes the data range to +/−2000 degrees per second (dps), which is adequate for most applications. Table 7 shows a brief summary of the devices hardware specification.

One suitable GPS 410 is the RXM-GPS-SR GPS module from Linx Technologies is a self-contained low-power GPS module with integrated patch antenna, LNA and SAW filter. It is based on the SiRFstar III chipset and targets low power applications. The low-power consumption is based on an adaptive trickle power control, which cycles between power modes once a position fix is determined. The GPS module consumes the most power than all other sensors, so disabling the GPS module can save hours of battery-life. Table 8 shows a brief summary of the devices hardware specification.

A binary converter utility (Windows executable file) is provided to convert the binary sensor log files to a human readable comma delimited format (CSV), which also normalizes the data units as described below in Table 9.


To execute the conversion tool, specify the input file path and the optional output directory path and rotation angles as shown below:



BinaryLogConverter.exe <filepath> [output directory] [x-axis rotation (deg)] [y-axis rotation (deg)] [z-axis rotation (deg)]

If a parsing error occurs (e.g., file corruption) the binary log converter will drop corrupted samples and continue parsing.




PDR device 316 includes networking capabilities by using the self-contained wireless module 403, which may be provided by Redpine Signals. This module is an IEEE 802.11abgn Wi-Fi client with integrated RF, baseband processing, MAC and power savings. A low-level SPI driver is provided and supported by Repine Signals, which required minor modification for our purposes. FIG. 31 illustrates a high-level system diagram for the module.The memory capacity on the MSP430xF55xx processor 402 is 8 KB plus an additional 2 KB reserved memory for the USB peripheral. The firmware takes advantage of the additional 2 KB of memory by creating a dynamic memory pool for general purpose usage when USB services are not enabled. The firmware currently does not have sufficient RAM to offer all available features such as data streaming service, axis rotations, and motion-based event triggering. As results these features are disabled. To overcome this limitation, the MSP430 processor with 16 KB of RAM can be used with hardware revisions.PDR device 310 power consumption varies based on enabled sensors/devices, data rates and sensor states (e.g., GPS lock). The PDR has to have two main operating modes: idle and recording. Idle mode is a low power (<1 mA) operation mode for automatic record triggering.The PDR firmware consists of the program and data memory associated with the hardware that gets executed on the MSP430x 16-bit microprocessor 402. The operating system or kernel is based on SYS/BIOS 6.x kernel, which provides real-time scheduling and hardware specific options such as power management. The firmware is designed to support all data bus (UART, SPI, etc.) and user-interfaces (e.g., button & LED), FAT16 file system, file configuration parsing, and services such as recording, USB mass-storage (USB MSC), and the file transfer network protocol (FTP). A high-level flow chart for the firmware is illustrated in FIG. 32.When device 310 is powered on, all interfaces and devices are initialized. If a component fails, the device reports an unrecoverable system error (red LED status) and the unit must be power-cycled. This should not happen, but to assure successful initialization, sensor or application level features can be disabled in the configuration file.Once the device is in idle mode, three different services are supported: sensor recording, mass-storage interface and networking. The recording service powers on and enables all sensors and interfaces to log raw binary data to external flash, which includes a FAT16 file system. The remaining services are used to retrieve binary log files and perform common file system tasks: File transfer network protocol (FTP) and USB mass-storage interface.The PDR hardware has a complex and strict power sequencing and initialization routine as illustrated in FIG. 33. If any process or hardware component fails, the PDR device will report an unrecoverable system error (red status LED) and will require power cycling. Components and processes can be disabled in the configuration file for debugging and identifying the cause of the initialization error.Initialization include parsing the configuration file and initializing device drivers (e.g., sensors, flash, Wi-Fi, etc.). Once initialization is completed successfully, the device is powered down into low-power mode 0 (LPM0), which disables all MSP430x system clocks and consumes approximately 300 uW of power. The device automatically wakes up when an interrupt from the main button or a sensor is received by the CPU.The device configuration file allows the user to configure sensors, rates, networking and other application specific settings. The configuration filename is “config.pdr” and is located in the root directory of the 4 GB micro-SD flash drive. The configuration file is defined by a set of groups with <key,value> pairs. The configuration file is based on a strict ASCII format and is easily acceptable to parsing errors.The device group defines read-only hardware specific settings.

Setting all angles to zero bypasses the matrix computation, which increases processing capabilities (i.e., supports high data rates). When the rotation is enabled, the sensor data rates should be lowered due an increase in processing load to avoid data loss.

Up to five access-point groups can be defined in the configuration file, which is a prioritized list.

password=pdr}Data storage is supported with a 4 GB external flash via a removable micro-SD card 405. The flash is expected to be formatted to FAT16 to provide an easy-to-use drive interface. Data processing consists of handling data events (interrupts) from all sensors, processing samples (scaling, rotating, etc.) and then writing to a managed and thread safe buffer. Each sensor (accelerometers 404a,b, altimeter 408, GPS 410, gyrometer 406) consists of a hardware interrupt that automatically notifies the MSP430x processor 402 when new data is ready. Each sample is then converted and time stamped into a binary packet. The data packet includes a 10-byte header and payload section, where the header includes the packet type, code word and time (millisecond resolution).The buffer consists of 2048 bytes of memory laid out in 4 blocks of 512 bytes as shown in FIG. 34. A block of 512 bytes is used to match the flash's block size, where the minimal transfer size to flash is 512 bytes. Since RAM is limited, the reserved USB 340 memory is used; therefore USB 340 features are not supported during recording operations. The event and data manager synchronize read operations from sensor events (i.e., samples) and write operations to external flash (micro-SD). The buffer manager also includes a flush operation when recording is disabled. This is required because a data packet can cross a 512-byte boundary.If a buffer overflow occurs due to limited processing power, the PDR device will report an unrecoverable system error. To reduce likelihood of such error, the sensor data rates should be reduced.The sensor data rates (i.e., bandwidth) are also limited by the write-access time for external flash. The upper limited was measured to be 100 KB/s when no additional processes were running. The effective throughput is lower, and is determined by CPU processing loads during interrupt handling, rate and computation. The estimated recording bandwidth is 35.4 KB/s as shown in Table 19.

Automatic event triggering is used to toggle operation modes (e.g., idle to recording) based on events driven by the hardware sensors (e.g., free-fall, thresholds, etc.).Gyrometer 406 in the prototype is not an ultra-low power components (<1 mA), so to minimize power consumption in the idle mode, the accelerometers 404a,b and altimeter 408 detectors are expected to be used for automatic triggering. One benefit of having two accelerometers 404a,b is to have up to 4 independent event triggers. The following describes the hardware detectors supported for each sensor:Accelerometer (404a, 404b)Single threshold eventDouble threshold eventActivity and inactivity events (threshold over time)Free-fallAltimeter (408)Single threshold eventGyrometer (406)Single threshold detection eventDuration threshold events (e.g., how long above threshold)The firmware supports Wi-Fi 403 network service when a 5V-powered USB 412b is attached to the device (no USB host). The primary service is the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), which provides a standard and well known method to access the device's file system, perform file transfers and other site-specific features. As part of the FTP service a sensor data streaming service (SDSS) is also supported. This allows a user to visualize sensor data in a readable and normalized format from a client application. The SDSS service is currently not supported by the web-based GUI application, but may include a binary format to achieve faster transfer rates.The file transfer protocol (FTP) server in one embodiment is a limited version of the specification, but offers minimal feature to be compatible with well-known applications such as WinSCP and FileZilla. Table 20 provides a list of the supported commands.

The FTP service supports several site-specific commands that are used for configuration and controlling additional services as shown in Table 21.

The external real-time clock (RTC) 414 of PDR device 310 is used to maintain the date and time while the device is powered off. The battery 412a supplies RTC 414 power, so if the battery 412a is removed or exhausted the date and time will be reset. The site-specific RTC command enables the user to remotely set or query the RTC time.The next command includes a secondary Wi-Fi 403 service called the sensor data streaming service (SDSS). This service enables sensors as requested and transmits normalized samples in a CSV ASCII format over a TCP network connection. Once the service is initialized, five TCP servers are created. The port identifier for each service is determined by the specific port field when sending the STM command. Each server (e.g., sensor) has a unique port identifier that is indexed based on the base port identifier. Once a client connects to the service, the sensor is enabled and data is automatically transmitted from the device at the specified rate.

The software is a web-based GUI application that incorporates Applicant's Java based software infrastructure. The application manages user and performance data, and consists of additional tools for device scanning, configuration, data extraction, and visualization. The user data is associated with scheduling, users, and their roles (admin, jumper, jumpmaster, etc.) as well as equipment (e.g., parachutes, equipment, PDR devices 310). The performance data is associated with the processed or raw sensor data from PDR device 310. The user and performance data is stored in a SQL database.The software is a web-based application written using the Grails application framework. Grails is an Open Source, full stack, web application framework for the JVM. It takes advantage of the Groovy programming language and convention over configuration to provide a productive and stream-lined development experience. Java 7 a Grails version 2.2.1 were used to developed the PDR software.Other libraries that are used include:

jQuery (http://jquery.com/), JavaScript framework
Bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), CSS framework
Rickshaw (http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/), data plotting JavaScript framework

FIG. 35 illustrates the overall workflow. A jump session is first created and the session is configured with jumpers and equipment (including assigning jumpmaster and checking out equipment including PDR devices). Then the jumps can be performed. Once back at the “base,” an administrator can scan for the returned devices and import the recorded performance data. The imported performance data should then be associated with the appropriate session (has to be done manually). Once this is done, the used equipment can be returned to make it available for future jumpers. Now the performance data can be previewed and exported for further analysis.It is possible for an administrator to create new, and delete existing users. Each user can have one or multiple roles. The roles presently include, but are not limited to:AdministratorJumperJumpmasterQuarter masterNot all roles need to be used. The administrator has full access to the application and can modify any database object, and is also the only user who can create or modify users. FIG. 36 shows an example of the GUI showing a list of current users. User details can be seen by clicking on the username of a particular user. There is also a link to create a new user in the upper right corner.Each user can also have the following information associated with it:UsernamePasswordFirst nameLast nameFIG. 37 shows a screenshot for adding a new user using the PDR software. Only defined users can be associated with jump sessions and be associated with performance data.The session section of the GUI allows users to plan jump sessions. This includes stating when the jump session will take place using an intuitive calendar view. The calendar provides an overview of all the jump sessions, either in a month, week, or day view. Example of a month view and a day view are shown in FIG. 38.Clicking on a session allows regular users to view information about the session, including any performance data that may be associated with the session.Administrator users on the other hand can create new sessions and edit existing sessions. To create a session the administrator can click (month view), or click and drag (week and day view), on the calendar. After this is done the user will be prompted to provide a session name. The administrator can now add or remove jumpers from the session, state which jumper is the jumpmaster, and equip the jumpers. Equipment includes parachutes, PDR devices, or other equipment (e.g., oxygen tanks, video cameras). FIG. 39 shows the details of an example session.Future sessions are jump sessions that have not yet taken place. Whether a session that has taken place is not determined by the session time vs. the current time, but is rather determined by whether or not any performance data has been associated with the session (i.e., performance data has been collected). If this is the case, then the session is considered “historical,” otherwise it is considered a “future” session.FIG. 40 illustrates the general workflow for creating, viewing and editing jump sessions.When an administrator edits a future session by assigning equipment to the declared jumpers, the equipment is “checked out,” i.e., made not available to other jumpers. After a jump session is performed and the performance data is imported, a depot manager can collect the equipment and then click a “return all equipment” button while editing the session to mark the equipment as returned and available to be lent out again. After a session is considered historical, editing the session (including equipping jumpers and making other modifications) does not affect the status of equipment. Hence, only the “return all equipment” functionality actually marks equipment as available. This allows for administrators to make corrections to historical sessions while not affecting the workflows of other future sessions and the availability of equipment.The PDR devices 110, 210, 310 can be accessed both over USB 340 and over a Wi-Fi wireless connection 403. When the device is connected via USB 340 to a computer, it is shown as a standard USB mass storage drive and its contents can be accessed via the file system. Furthermore, the contents of PDR devices 110, 210, 310 can be accessed over a wireless network 403 using the FTP server built into the device.Syncing the PDR's sensor data is typically an action performed by an administrator. We separate between the USB and the wireless mode. Hence, the user can either scan for USB devices 340 or wireless devices 403. FIG. 41 shows the overview of this workflow.When USB devices 340 are scanned for, the software tries to find all the “root” devices attached to the computer in question (how this is done is platform specific, but we are assuming a Windows platform here). Root devices include hard-drives or any mounted USB devices 340 with a file system which are searched for config.pdr files. The availability of this file may identify the root device in question as a PDR device. Next the configuration file is parsed to get the device ID. If this is successful, the device is identified as a PDR device and added to the list of found devices. See FIG. 42 for an example of a PDR device found via USB.To scan for devices over a wireless network we need the network to scan and the range of IP addresses to scan. An administrator can configure this in the software by providing a range of IP addresses. This is specified as e.g., “192.1681.*”. This means that 256 addresses will be scanned, ranging from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255. In one embodiment of the system, only the last part of the IP configuration can accept a wildcard (*). When saved, this information will be stored in a Java properties file named pdrweb.properties. For each IP address in the range, it is attempted to connect to the IP via FTP (port 21). If the connection is successful, an attempt to download (using the “RETR” command) the configuration file config.pdr is made. If this is successful and the file can be parsed to retrieve the device ID to be added to the list of found devices. An example of a PDR device found via Wi-Fi is shown in FIG. 43.The open-source FTP library ftp4j at http://www.sauronsoftware.it/projects/ftp4j/ can be used to interact with the FTP server on the PDR devices.For each scanning mode (USB 340 or wireless 403), when the list of found devices has been retrieved, they can be displayed to the user in a list. Each device in the list can be checked or unchecked to indicate whether the device should be included when trying to import sensor data from the device.After scanning for devices over USB 340 or wireless 403 and displaying the list of found devices to the user, the user can optionally click to configure any of the found devices. Doing so opens up a separate page where the user can easily change any of the values in the configuration file.After scanning for devices, it is important to remember where the path was found. In the case of USB 340, the path is a file system path, i.e., “e:/” or “f:/” depending on the location of the USB device. In the case of wireless 403, the path is the IP address where the device was found. Using this path we can directly retrieve the configuration file (config.pdr), parse it and populate the UI with the contents. Again, how we retrieve the configuration file depends on the format of the path. If the path is a valid IP address, the configuration file is accessed using the ftp4j library, and if the path is a valid file path, it is retrieved and parsed using the file system. A screenshot for configuring a PDR device is shown in FIG. 44.After the user has made any modifications to the configuration and clicks “Save,” the file is written back from where it was fetched (over the file system in the case of USB and using the FTP command “STOR” in the case of wireless).An underlying SQL (MySQL implementation) database stores all the user and performance data. The Grails framework: Grails Object Relational Mapping (GORM) database layer (which is implemented using Hibernate) can be used. The GORM layer allows specifying database tables as class objects and can automatically create and update the database tables. GORM also provides functionality to query the stored data using standard object-oriented access methods.The database used is configured in the conf/DataSource.groovy class. Alternatively, the database access configuration can be overridden by providing a $HOME/.grails/pdrweb-config.groovy file. This second alternative makes it easy to override the database configuration when the application has already been deployed.In the sections below, additional details of database models are provided and how data is being managed.Once the importing of data is started from a device, the general workflow in FIG. 45 is followed.If no jumps are found, there is nothing to do. Jumps are found by iterating over the file structure on the device (either directly if over USB or via FTP if accessing the device over the wireless network). The sensor data are stored in SENSOR.BIN files in a pre-defined folder structure:/DEVICEROOT/[DAYFOLDER]/REC_[JUMP NUMBER]/SENSOR.BINThe DAYFOLDER is formatted according to “yyyyMMdd” where “yyyy” is the year, “MM” the month and “dd” the day of the month. For example, the folder may be named “20130324”. In such day folders, there may be any number of jump folders with the naming convention “REC_[JUMP NUMBER]” where JUMP_NUMBER is a non-negative integer ({0, 1, 2, 3, . . . }). For each jump there is a SENSOR.BIN file that contains the recorded sensor data.For each SENSOR.BIN file found, it is checked to see if the jump has already been imported. A jump is uniquely identified by the tuple <device id, day of jump, jump number>. If the jump has already been imported, it is skipped. If it has not been imported, the SENSOR.BIN file is copied from the device onto the local hard drive. Once copied, the SENSOR.BIN file is converted into a set of Comma Separated Value (CSV) files. Each CSV file contains the data from a specific sensor on the PDR device. For each generated CSV file, all its data is inserted into the database.Each sensor type has its own table in the database. Each such sensor data table contains three common columns:1. id (The ID of the record)2. pdr (The PDR device ID)3. day (The day of the jump)4. jump (The jump number)The remaining columns in each sensor data table are specific to the particular data that is being stored. FIG. 46 shows the table definition for the High G acceleration data.As can be seen in FIG. 46, the High G Acceleration data has four data specific columns:1. seconds (the number of seconds from midnight on the particular day)2. x (the x-axis value)3. y (the y-axis value)4. z (the z-axis value)To insert the High G Acceleration data into this table, an efficient mechanism supported by MySQL is used to insert data from CSV files. The following SQL prepared statement is created to do this:LOAD DATA INFILE [path to CSV file] INTO TABLE [table]FIELDS TERMINATED BY ‘,’ ([columns]) SET pdr=?, day=?, jump=?The path to the CSV file is specified, as well as the table name and the columns that are specific to the sensor data type. The questions marks (?) are part of the prepared statement and are instantiated before the command is issued. They ensure that each data record has the appropriate data to allow it to be known where the data comes from. A concrete SQL statement would be:LOAD DATA INFILE ‘c:/data/accel_high_g.csv’ INTO TABLE data_accel_high_gFIELDS TERMINATED BY ‘,’ (seconds, x, y, z) SET pdr=0001, day=′2013-12-01′, jump=1This is a very efficient way of inserting data from CSV files into a MySQL database. The other sensor data database table definitions can be found in FIG. 47.Despite using efficient methods to insert the data into the database, it might take some time to insert all the data; especially if the data files are large. To avoid locking up the application, these imports are done in background threads. A separate thread is created for each device. To allow the user to know how the import job is progressing, a job status object can be generated for each background thread. As the job is processing, progress status is updated (0-100%) and a jobs log with messages that describe that progress. This information is displayed to the user while the background job is processing. When the job is done, the progress bar shows that it is at 100% and the job's complete status flag is set to “true.” FIG. 48 is a screenshot showing the progress of performance data importing.The database table structure for jobs and their logs is shown in FIG. 49.Once performance data has been imported and inserted into the database, the connection between sessions and jumps must be known, i.e., which session was an imported jump part of? In one embodiment, no automated reasoning is provided to determine this.

The Web application provides a simple interface and plotting capability to preview sensor data (see an example in FIG. 50). The user can select:The sensor type to view data fromThe time window of data to view (i.e., start and end point)The sample rate (i.e., how many data points to view)The specified data is fetched from the database and displayed in the Web application. The Rickshaw JavaScript library is used to visualize the data. In this embodiment of the invention, no analytical capabilities are provided, but simply allow the user to view the data.To support the full cycle of data management, all the data associated with a jump can be exported. All the performance data from the jump can easily be exported using a single click by pressing the “Download all data” button (see FIG. 50). Each sensor data type that is available for a jump is exported into a separate CSV file. When this is done for each sensor type, the CSV files are archived into a ZIP file and make this file available for download.In a reversal of the way the data was imported from CSV files, the export is done using the following command:SELECT [columns] INTO OUTFILE ‘[output file]’FIELDS TERMINATED BY ‘,’ LINES TERMINATED BY ‘\\n’FROM [table name]WHERE pdr=? AND day=? AND jump=? ORDER BY ‘seconds’The columns that should be exported is specific to the data type, the output file is given a name related to the sensor data type, and the table name again depends on the sensor type. The “pdr,” “day” and “jump” values come from the specific jump from which the data is being exported.A concrete SQL statement for High G Acceleration data can look as the following:SELECT seconds, x, y, z INTO OUTFILE ‘c:/data/accel_high_g.csv’FIELDS TERMINATED BY ‘,’ LINES TERMINATED BY ‘\\n’FROM data_accel_high_gWHERE pdr=0001 AND day=′2013-12-01′ AND jump=1 ORDER BY ‘seconds’The exported data can be used for further analysis.In one embodiment, only limited visualization of the data is provided in a simple way of previewing the data. More robust visualization capabilities can be added to the PDR software.In one embodiment, no analytic capabilities are provided in the PDR software; however, as users may want to perform analytics on the data, preliminary algorithms have been developed to extract event markers and information of interest to parachute designers, users, commanders, and instructors. These analytical capabilities can be added to the PDR software.In one embodiment, finding PDR devices over the wireless network requires knowing what network to scan, and what range of IP addresses to scan. In another embodiment, it can be specified exactly which IP addresses to scan in a compact way, i.e., to be very precise in what range of addresses to scan. Scanning the network and finding USB devices can be time consuming, so scanning only the required IP address for devices can speed up the response time of the application.In one embodiment, the PDR software assumes an intended workflow and an order of performed steps, and if these steps are not followed, errors may occur, but it is possible to improve error handling if the workflow is not followed.In one embodiment, PDR devices are identified by a hexadecimal number while the application currently treats the IDs as strings, but a common way of handling device IDs can also be used.In one embodiment, the Parachute Data Recorder (PDR) stores data measured by two sets of tri-axial accelerometers 404a,b (i.e., “low-g” limited at 4 gs and “high-g” limited at 16 gs), a suite of tri-axial gyros 406, a temperature gauge, and a pressure sensor (for calculation of altitude). Such data are integrated into a single unit to provide basic physical information about all stages of a parachute jump, namely: jump from the aircraft; free-fall; parachute deployment and opening; descent and landing. This physical information includes fall (or free-fall) duration, parachute deployment and opening durations, and parachute descent duration; rates of altitude loss; accelerations and decelerations, as well as its rotational rates.Some of the raw PDR data, like event durations and altitudes, can be directly applied to the dynamics and kinematics of the parachutist (or “jumper”) 500 (FIG. 51). However, most of the PDR output necessitates extensive analysis and interpretation before being relevant to a jumper's body motions and dynamics. Such is the case with PDR accelerations and gyro rates, which at face value only apply to PDR translations and gyrations. As sketched in FIG. 53, connecting PDR device 310 and jumper body 50 motions require coordinate and axes transformations from the PDR's reference axes to other reference frames fixed on both the parachutist's center of gravity (CG) and to the ground.As shown in FIGS. 52, 54 and 55, the PDR accelerometer 404a,b and gyrometer 406 signals are distinct enough during each stage of a jump to provide a set of useful markers by which the duration of these stages can be evaluated. Duration is a key element here, by which the external forces applied on a parachutist can be estimated via the Momentum-Impulse Theorem (or MI theorem for short). This is particularly true—and important—during the parachute opening stage when the loads on the body are at their highest.The MI theorem links, via Newton's 2nd law of motion, the momentum change during time interval tf−ti of a parachutist's body 500 (here represented by a point mass located at the body's CG), to the time integral of the net external forces acting on the body. Focusing on the momentum and force components along the fall trajectory of the parachutist, one has the following expression, which involves the time-varying net force Fnet(t) and the body weight component tangential to the trajectory):

Here m and W refer to the mass and weight of the jumper, respectively. The flight angle θ(t) is defined so that a 0°-value corresponds to a parachute-payload system falling straight down, and a 90°-value to a system traveling horizontally (and to the right). The speeds V(ti)≡Vi and V(tf)≡Vf refer to the jumper's tangential speeds at times tf and ti, respectively. Note that with this notation, both Vi and Vf are positive as long as 0°<θ(t)<90°. Moreover, −Fnet corresponds to the tangential component of the total force (i.e., besides weight) applied on the body 500: namely, body drag during free-fall, or body drag plus riser pull during parachute deployment and opening (note that per FIG. 56, Fnet is opposite to V, hence the negative sign in equation (2).Although equation (2) is exact and applies to any time intervals tf−ti of relevance to any of the five stages of a jump, its use will be limited here to parachute 502 opening, with tf−ti corresponding to the beginning and end of this particular stage.Noting that dividing the integral of Fnet by the interval tf−ti in equation (2) yields an equation involving the average force Faver, one has:

This result is also exact. In what follows we are interested in two specific types of trajectories, namely purely vertical and purely horizontal trajectories, for which equation (3) simplifies greatly (and exactly).

mVf−mVi=−Faver(tf−ti)horizontal  (4)

mVf−mVi=(−Faver+W)(tf−ti)vertical  (5)
When applied to parachute 502 inflation, these two expressions actually yield lower and upper bounds on parachute drag (and thus averaged riser force).Accordingly, the values of the time interval (tf−ti) and speed increment/decrement (Vf−V1), as well as of the weight W, will bound the average (tangential) net force. Since the speed increment/decrement isn't directly measured by in this context of using PDR data as event markers, it is assumed that the system decelerates significantly during inflation (yielding Vf<<Vi)—a scenario that is valid for personnel or cargo parachutes (or more generally “landing” parachutes). This assumption then allows recasting equations (3) and (4) and (5) as:

Note that this result does not apply to stabilization parachutes (or “drogues”) which typically do not decelerate a great deal during inflation. At this point, the MI theorem shows that an average force estimate can be obtained from knowing: 1) the mass and weight of the jumper's body; 2) the fall speed just prior to deployment; and 3), the duration of the opening stage, as inferred from the raw PDR accelerometer data used as event markers (see FIGS. 54 and 55). Given that the weight, jump altitude and jump type are data entered into the “configuration file” of the PDR prior to jumping, the value of the mass m and fall speed V; can also be estimated by the PDR, and the average force thus calculated from the time intervals, albeit post-jump (Note: here m=W/g with g=32.17 ft/s2; Vi˜(2 W/ρ·10 ft2)0.5 for a free-fall, or Vi=known measured number (TBD) for static line jumps from C-130 or C-17 aircraft).The “peak” or maximum riser force sustained by the jumper (Fmax) can also be estimated from equation (1), this time via the use of two approximations, rather than just one as with Faver. Using Fmax (besides weight) in equation (2) yields:

Parameter Iif is the so-called drag integral which contains the information related to the shape of the Fnet-vs.-t curve, effectively a measurement of the (normalized) area under that curve. This integral is such that the force evolutions involving a nearly constant force during the entire time interval is characterized by Iif˜1, while evolutions characterized by a dominating triangular peak yield Iif˜½. For unreefed “round” or near-hemispherical personnel parachutes 502a such as the (US Army) T-10 and (USAF) C-9, one finds Iif˜0.50-0.65; and for personnel slider-reefed parafoils (including the US Army MC-4) and slider-reefed round parachutes (Butler HX-600), one has Iif˜0.40-0.50. Assuming again Vf<<Vi (thus restricting to personnel canopies), and focusing again on purely horizontal and vertical 0trajectories, equation (8) and the Iif values prescribed in known references yield the following results:Unreefed round parachute types (incl.

Here again the time interval is obtained from the accelerometer data used as event markers (FIGS. 54 and 55) and from all other data pre-calculated by the PDR using its “use file.” Note that equations (12) and (13) may be applicable to the Army T-11 which is also a slider-reefed canopy very much like the hemispherical Butler HX-600. Although further load-cell testing with a T-11 needs to be implemented to get the needed drag integral data, Applicant believes that equations (12) and (13) could be a good educated guess and thus a good starting point for this particular parachute. (Note: the US Army may already have such load cell data, obtained during the R&D phase of the T-11 program (i.e., ATPS Program)).Average and peak riser forces (neglecting body drag) sustained during the test jumps pdrtj1tal and pdrtj2ta can be quickly calculated from equations (7) and (13) since both parachute deployment and opening occurred along a purely vertical fall trajectory. This simple calculation is implemented in the Excel spreadsheet. FIGS. 57 and 58 show the typical outputs of the spreadsheet. This type of free-fall parachute jump will contrast with static-line jumps for which the trajectory is ballistic (i.e., 2-dimensional), and for which 4a,b and 8a,b need to be used to get bounded estimates of the forces. The input parameters for jumps pdrtj1tal and pdrtj2tal are as follows:W=2201 bs (as weighted on a scale) and using m=W/g with g=32.17 ft/s2 yields m=6.5351Deploy altitude=4000 to 5000 ft MSL (yielding ρ=0.00211 to 0.0020 sl/ft3)The fall speed prior to parachute opening is usually very close to the fall rate during deployment, which itself is close to the speed of free-fall. Being standard skydiving jumps, the fall rates sustained during the free-falls of pdrtj1tal and pdrtj2tal are thus expected to be in the range of 100 to 110 mph. Converting such free-fall speeds in feet per second yields:Vi=147 to 162 ft/sNaturally, and because of the purely vertical nature of the trajectory, the fall rates can also be obtained from the PDR pressure data when the free-fall is stable, namely during time intervals 53.56 s−67.11 s (pdrtj1tal) and 73.89 s-98.85 s (pdrtj2tal). This PDR data suggest the following fall rates at the time of parachute deployment:Vi=159 ft/s (pdrtj1tal) and 166 ft/s (pdrtj2tal)i.e., values which are quite consistent with published values. The falls speed uncertainties in both types of estimates arise from the changes in body shape that occur as results of maneuvering.The information on parachute opening duration needed in equations (6)-(7) and (12)-(13) is provided here by the PDR accelerometer 404a,b data, which suggest tf−ti=2.5 s (±0.10 s) for both pdrtj1tal and pdrtj2tal (see y-axis data, in FIGS. 54 and 55). It should be noted that during deployment, the body and PDR rotate from a horizontal to a vertical attitude; then both PDR device 310 and parachutist body 502, 502a remain vertical during parachute opening.Given the initial speeds (V) from the PDR data and drag integral (Iif), using equations (7) and (13) yields the average and peak riser forces in the range of Faver˜655-6741 bs and Fpeak˜1089-13551 bs.The force information just obtained can be easily translated into decelerations and compared to the PDR acceleration data, given the simple and vertical nature of the trajectory:

From equation (7), one gets aaver/g values displayed in FIG. 58, i.e., in the range of aaver/g˜1.98 to 2.06 g's and apeak/g˜3.95 to 5.16 g's. The comparison of these numbers with PDR Y-axis accelerometer (FIGS. 54 and 55) is straightforward, that is, once the axis conventions used in equation (7) and with the PDR are first identified. Using Applicant's convention (FIG. 59), and the fact that the +Y axis pointed downwards during parachute opening (see PDR emplacement on the harness in FIG. 51, where the “on” button is facing out and up), one uses the formula apdfcalled/g=(apdrraw output/g)+1 to get the true (or “called”) acceleration from the raw data in this particular PDR orientation. And since the reference +Y axis is opposite to the axis used in equation (7),one has aeq,9/g=−apdrcalled/g. From these conventions, we haveaeq,9/g=−apdrcalled/g−(apdrraw output/g)−1orapdrraw output/g=−(aeq,9/g)−1i.e., results that “predict” the raw PDR Y-axis accelerometer data reading as:apdrraw output/g|aver˜−2.98 to −3.06 g'sandapdrraw output/g|peak˜−4.95 to −6.16 g'sThese numbers are consistent with the averaged PDR Y-accelerometer data during parachute opening (FIGS. 54 and 55):Pdrtj1tal: apdrraw output/g|aver˜−2.62±0.69 g's (i.e., data with 1.38 standard deviation)andPdrtj2tal: apdrraw output/g|aver˜−2.51±0.96 g's (i.e., data with 1.93 standard deviation)Known raw peak deceleration data also compares favorably with the results of equations (12)-(13).Ultimately, PDR accelerometer output yield the accelerations sustained by the body 500, and by virtue of Newton's 2nd law of motion, the resultant force at play. With regards to the latter, PDR accelerometer data potentially offer a more complete and more accurate calculation of the riser forces. But as outlined below, the required analysis is significantly more involved. Moreover, such an analysis requires further characterizations of the system (i.e., supplemental input data).Because the PDR will most likely be located a distance away from any parachutist 500 center of gravity (CG), its accelerometer and gyro data yield direct information not of the body but of the PDR's own translations and gyrations (see FIG. 56). Obtaining motion information of the jumper 500 CG, or of any other body part (such as the head), will require coordinate and axes transformations from the PDR's reference axes to other reference frames located on the body's CG and on the ground (FIG. 56).Calculating the motions of a parachutist's CG (here assumed as “known” or at least “knowable”) is achieved via the calculation of the position vector RCG shown in FIG. 56. This step first requires knowing with some accuracy the location of the PDR with respect to the CG, resulting in the vector Rpdr-cg which is then used in the calculation of RCG via a vector addition operation (RCG=Rpdr-cg+RPDR). The CG acceleration calculation follows from using the PDR acceleration data (aPDR) in the acceleration vector identity aCG=apdr-cg+aPDR, with the acceleration apdr-cg of the straight line joining the PDR and body CG (Rpdr-cg) calculated from the tilting rate of the PDR accelerometer axes as obtained from the PDR gyros 406.In principle, the acceleration algorithm just described can work for any PDR axes orientations. However, simplification in the mathematics can be achieved if the PDR axes are fixed on the parachute equipment 502 in ways to be aligned with the main symmetry axes of the body 500 as well as with the gravitational field. One way is to align one of the axes with the jumper's head-to-feet line; another along the line formed by the jumper's extended arms; and the third along a direction orthogonal to the first two axes. Attaching the PDR to the front section of the shoulder harness as shown in FIG. 51 would approximately meet this requirement. Alternatively, placing the PDR device 310 in a pouch sewn externally to the side of the reserve container would work as well (and perhaps more accurately), but only whenever the reserve parachute remains unused (FIG. 60). Yet another location, i.e., inside the reserve container and against the back pad, has been mentioned in previous discussions and would offer an even better alternative.Knowing the direction of the gravitational field is necessary to figure out the axes of the reference frame fixed to ground as well as to remove the effects of gravity from the PDR acceleration outputs. The latter is important since gravity yields non-zero accelerometer readings even when the PDR sits on a table at rest or moves at constant velocity. Thus the knowledge of the value of the angle θ (FIG. 61), as well as the other angles measured for the +X and +Y accelerometer axes, is needed at all times in order to gravity-correct the PDR accelerometer at all times (FIG. 61). These angles can be computed over time using the PDR gyro data, as long as the orientation of the PDR axes with respect to the gravity field is known at some time prior to the jump. Thus a calibration step is needed, after the unit is powered up but prior to the jump itself. Such a step can be as simple as an agreed-upon number of taps on the PDR unit by the jumper or jumpmaster, with the jumper in a standing position.A typical PDR pressure data output is shown in FIGS. 62 and 63, in comparison with the output of the Z-axis high-g accelerometer. Unlike with the accelerometer data, the pressure readings among the various stages of a jump are different enough to track the duration of most, but not all events. For example, the change of slope is particularly striking during parachute deployment and opening. During deployment, the fall rate of the jumper remains close to that of the free-fall, but then decreases rapidly when the parachute begins inflating. On the other hand, and unlike accelerometer data, pressure data is not that particularly useful in discriminating the various parafoil flight maneuvers that could be executed during the descent, although it becomes obvious at the moment of landing.Pressure data is more useful for the calculation of the vertical component of the fall rate when the trajectory is 2- or 3-dimensional (or “ballistic”). When the trajectory is purely vertical, the vertical component of the fall rate becomes the fall rate. Both calculations can be carried out using the methods described below.Although discussed in the context of long duration free-fall by skydivers, the following methodology may also be used to calculate the vertical component of the fall rate in the ballistic trajectories of static-line jumpers.Because the atmospheric pressure is correlated with altitude H (Mean Sea Level reference), it is possible to extract parachutist fall rates (i.e., altitude loss rates) from pressure rates. As shown in equation 1 below, the fall rate (Vfreefall) is measured from the PDR pressure data (P), in particular from the rate dP/dt of pressure change per unit time during the free-fall, an input that is directly extracted from the PRD pressure data (see FIGS. 64 and 65). But the calculation requires also knowing the variation of atmospheric pressure as a function of altitude (dP/dH)—an input that isn't known from the PDR data stream. Such pressure profile may be obtained from daily/hourly measurements at locations nearest to the jump. Alternatively, one can use the profile of the so-called Standard Atmosphere which is mathematically described by equations (15) and (16) used here.

Above that level both pressure and dP/dH decrease exponentially with height.The value of Vfreefall during test jumps pdrtj1tal and pdrtj2tal can be obtained by first solving equation (14) for Vfreefall:

Equations (15) and (16) are then used to get dP/dH, again in lieu of actual meteorological data. Here dP/dt is obtained from the PDR pressure readings, i.e., by calculating the slope of the pressure vs. time curve. In FIGS. 64 and 65, the slope (during free-fall) is remarkably constant and so dP/dt has the same value during the entire stage namely, 5.2957 mbar/s (pdrtj1tal) and 5.5262 mbar/s (pdrtj2tal). The difference between both slopes arose from the jumper wearing different jumpsuits, i.e., a “slow” (or loose) suit during pdrtj1tal and a “fast” (or tight) suit during pdrtj2tal. The computations (versus altitude) are shown in FIG. 66, with the fall speeds at deployment time (3000 to 4000 ft) evaluated at 159 ft/s and 166 ft/s, i.e., values that are in agreement with the published free-fall data.Other test jumps were performed with a full tactical support package as shown in FIGS. 67 and 67a. Each parachutist 500a carried either two PDRs 310 or one PDR 310 plus a smartphone for verification purposes. The PDR 319 unit was installed in the AR-2 pouch located on the left side of the MC-4 (365 cubic inches) parachute system as shown in FIGS. 67 and 67a. This location was used because the AR-2 pouch is close to the subject's center of gravity. The PDR was also rotated by approximately −60° on the z-axis, which requires a rotation transformation for correction. For each test, the PDR devices were activated and deactivated at the training facility, which captured the following events:



Travel to Airfield
Aircraft Motion (ascend, cruise)
Parachute Motion (jump from the aircraft; free-fall; parachute deployment and opening; descent and landing)
Travel to Facility



The tables below summarize the test subjects and jumps performed during the two days at YPG.



For each jump, the subjects performed similar tasks such as deploying from the back of the aircraft, free-falling for ˜4 seconds and maneuvering to a targeted landing zone. The following sections provide a detailed analysis of the data collected in this test.As described in Table 23, a PDR device was paired with an Android phone to verify and compare GPS performance during the airdrop. The devices were located on the side of the subject (AR-2 pouch), which provided excellent reception. In addition, the aircraft was equipped with a GPS repeater, which allowed the GPS to maintain lock prior to deployment. The recorded GPS altitude data for the PDR and Android device is shown in FIG. 68. The plot illustrates and verifies the subject's altitude profile throughout the scenario. The maximum error between the two devices is about 80 meters, and both devices lost GPS lock during the aircraft ascend phase.The data collected by the PDR device and the smartphone can also be verified through gyrometer data. The recorded gyrometer angular rate data for the PDR and Android device is shown in FIG. 69.The plot verifies the correctness of the PDR gyrometer data by comparing it with the Android device gyrometer data. Both sets of gyrometer data show similar trends.The graphs in FIG. 70 and A compare the estimated altitude between the PDR's GPS and altimeter sensor. The measured atmospheric pressure is converted to meters by using equation (1), which assumes a constant sea-level pressure of 1013.25 mbar.The maximum error between the GPS and altimeter is approximately 90 meters, and both devices captured an accurate descent rate during the airdrop. The altimeter measured anomalies in the air pressure during free-fall, which is caused by air pressure variations around the subject during flight.The graph in FIG. 71 shows the descent rate calculated from the altimeter for subject1/jump1. The descent rate is estimated by curve fitting a linear line to the estimated altitude as shown in FIG. 71. The estimated average descent rate is −4.88 m/s.The recorded altimeter data for PDR 310 Unit 2, Devices 4.6 and 4.10 is shown in FIGS. 72 and 72A (the right graph is a zoomed in version of the left). These plots verify the correctness of the pressure data by comparing measurements across PDR devices. These signals are so closely aligned that any differences between the signals can only be seen in the zoomed in plot.The recorded accelerometer data for PDR 310 Unit 2, Devices 4.6 and 4.10 is shown in FIG. 73. This plot verifies the correctness of the accelerometer data by comparing measurements across PDR devices. Acceleration shown is the sum of the squares to account for axes misalignment. The standard deviation of the difference between the signals is 0.205 g-forces. This is mostly due to a slight time misalignment, as a visual inspection of the data shows extremely similar results between the two devices.The altimeter data can be used to identify key events during the flight. Patterns in the data, along with data characteristics like maximum, minimum, and slope, are used to find the times of exit, the end of parachute inflation, and landing. These event marker times are used to calculate the time span of free-fall, deployment/inflation, and descent along with the descent rate (using the height information). These times can also then be applied to the data from the other sensors to identify data characteristics during different events. The recorded altimeter data for Jump 1, Unit 3 is shown in FIGS. 74 and 74A. The identified event markers have been automatically detected by the post-processing software.The accelerometer data is processed for the period of time between exit from the plane and landing, as identified by the altimeter data processing. This data can then be examined for significant events and data patterns.Before using the acceleration data, the axes are automatically transformed from their frame relative to the jumper so that they align with an absolute coordinate system in which the y-axis points towards the sky. This transformation for data from Jump 1 Unit 3 can be seen in FIG. 75.This data visually aligns with expectations for the jumper's acceleration. The big spike at the beginning is free-fall and parachute deployment. The spike at the end is when the jumper lands on the ground. As expected, for the entire middle period, the y-axis shows −1 g of acceleration and the x-axis and z-axis show almost zero acceleration. This confirms that the y-axis is pointing up as the jumper descends.The accelerometer data from the period of plane exit through parachute inflation can then be examined to determine the force felt by the jumper. A zoomed-in version of the accelerometer data for Jump 1 Unit 2 during this period of time can be seen in FIG. 76.Different events can easily be identified through the differences in acceleration. The maximum force for a given axis will be experienced in the y-axis due to the jumper's 500, 500a orientation at the time of parachute 502, 502a deployment. This maximum acceleration is automatically detected by software processing, which in this case is 8.192 Gs. This equates to

A similar analysis can be done for the landing. A zoomed-in version of the accelerometer data for Jump 1 Subject 2 during this period of time can be seen in FIG. 77.The maximum force for a given axis will be experienced in the y-axis due to the jumper's orientation at the time of parachute deployment. In this example, landing is identified at a time of 37900 seconds, which is the first time the acceleration in the y-axis exceeds 2 gs since the start of the descent. The two additional spikes are likely due to gear and landing and motions of the jumper post-landing. The acceleration force is automatically detected by software processing, which in this case is 2.35 Gs. This equates to

Additional analysis can be done on this data to detect the average force felt by the jumper and the accumulated force felt by the jumper. This can be done for certain periods of time or over the entire duration of the jump.The gyrometer data is processed for the period of time between exit from the plane and landing, as identified by the altimeter data processing. This data can then be examined for significant events and data patterns.The gyrometer data for Jump 1 Subject 1 can be seen in FIG. 78. The top plot shows raw gyrometer data. As can be seen, this data is encumbered by slow oscillations around the various axes. This low frequency information is not representative of any significant jump characteristics and obscures the important gyrometer data. Therefore, this data is high-pass filtered before it is examined, leaving only the high frequency information.The filtered gyrometer data for the middle portion of Jump 1 Subject 1 can be seen in FIG. 79. This data shows a relatively smooth flight for most of the descent. However, spikes can be seen every couple of minutes, identifying a point of high rotation. The spikes indicate the jumper 500a spinning, and can be isolated to get a count of the number of spins during a given period of time. Spikes are identified in the plot by the magenta and cyan dots. The ratio of spin count to time can be an indicator for the smoothness of the flight.The same information can be viewed in FIG. 80, which shows the filtered gyrometer data for the free-fall and deployment/inflation part of the jump. Again, the magenta and cyan dots show the amount of time spent in a rotation greater than 20 dps. These identified times can be used as a count and a ratio (of spins to time). The angular rate can also be integrated over a duration of time to see the total rotation experienced by the jumper. These angular rate calculations and counts can be used for an assessment of smoothness or how smooth the jump was overall (or for certain duration of time).A jump in which the reserve parachute had to be deployed (hereafter referred to as “Reserve Parachute Jump”) shows very different patterns from normal deployments. In a typical jump, major changes in vertical velocity (the derivative of the height measurements from the altimeter) occur immediately after exiting the aircraft. The vertical velocity spikes at around −2 (arbitrarily normalized units for comparison). Then after a major spike it becomes constant at some negative magnitude (for the period of descent). At the end of the descent, vertical velocity returns to zero. A plot of vertical velocity can be seen in FIG. 81.In the plot on the right of FIG. 81 of a typical jump, the data is as expected. The velocity spikes one time and then quickly becomes constant at around −0.2, indicating stable descent. In the plot on the left of FIG. 81 of the Reserve Parachute Jump, multiple velocity spikes precede a period of abnormally fast descent. The velocity doesn't stabilize until almost 50 seconds in, as opposed to other “normal” jumps where the velocity stabilized in 10-20 seconds.In a typical jump, there are major fluctuations in acceleration observed across all axes for the first 4-5 seconds post-jump during free fall. Then for about 2 seconds there are large spikes in the y-axis (which points up during descent) during parachute deployment and inflation. After parachute inflation, the acceleration is observed to quickly stabilizes, with the y-axis at −1 g and the x and z axes at 0 g. This whole process takes about 7 seconds.A plot of jump acceleration can be seen in FIG. 82. In the upper plot of a typical jump, the data is as expected. Free-fall, from the time of jump (37,300 seconds) to the time of parachute inflation (37,304.5), lasts 4.5 seconds. Parachute deployment inflation (from 37,304.5 to 37,306.5 seconds) lasts 2 seconds. Within the next few seconds, the acceleration has stabilized and everything is as expected.In the lower plot of the Reserve Parachute Jump, there is the expected initial area of free fall and deployment lasting around 7 seconds. However, there is then a period of about 15 seconds of relative stability in an unusual orientation. This is following by additional large acceleration spikes for another 30 seconds. The acceleration doesn't reach normal descent levels until about 50 seconds post jump.In a typical jump, there are major fluctuations in rotation across all axes for the first 7 seconds during free fall and parachute deployment/inflation. All rotations then stabilize for the remainder of descent with spikes every 20 seconds or so due to assumed intentional jumper spins.A plot of jump rotation can be seen in FIG. 83. In the upper plot of a typical jump, the data is as expected. Major spikes in rotation occur within the first 7 seconds post jump. Within the next few seconds, rotation has essentially ceased.In the lower plot of the Reserve Parachute Jump, major events can be seen in the rotation data for the duration of the first 50 seconds post jump. The initial 7 seconds of rotation are followed by two additional periods of activity in which rotation exceeds 100 dps, a rate much higher than normal for post inflation rotation.Typical maximum forces on the jumper were usually in the range of 4-6Gs during parachute inflation, with one instance as high as 8.5 Gs. In the Reserve Parachute Jump, initial force went as high as 9.3G. What is unusual is the multiple later occurrences also reaching over 4 Gs (on at least 3 separate occasions), indicating larger loads than should be expected.While the invention has been taught with specific reference to these embodiments, one skilled in the art will recognize that changes can be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.1.

These drawings illustrate certain details of specific embodiments that implement a module or method, or computer program product described herein. However, the drawings should not be construed as imposing any limitations that may be present in the drawings. The method and computer program product may be provided on any machine-readable media for accomplishing their operations. The embodiments may be implemented using an existing computer processor, or by a special purpose computer processor incorporated for this or another purpose, or by a hardwired system.As noted above, embodiments described herein may include a computer program product comprising machine-readable media for carrying or having machine-executable instructions or data structures stored thereon. Such machine-readable media may be any available media, which may be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer or other machine with a processor. By way of example, such machine-readable media can comprise RAM, ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that may be used to carry or store desired program code in the form of machine-executable instructions or data structures and that may be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer or other machine with a processor. When information is transferred or provided over a network or another communication connection (either hardwired, wireless, or a combination of hardwired or wireless) to a machine, the machine properly views the connection as a machine-readable medium. Thus, any such a connection is properly termed a machine-readable medium. Combinations of the above are also included within the scope of machine-readable media. Machine-executable instructions comprise, for example, instructions and data, which cause a general-purpose computer, special purpose computer, or special purpose processing machines to perform a certain function or group of functions.Embodiments will be described in the general context of method steps that may be implemented in one embodiment by a program product including machine-executable instructions, such as program codes, for example, in the form of program modules executed by machines in networked environments. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc., that have the technical effect of performing particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Machine-executable instructions, associated data structures, and program modules represent examples of program codes for executing steps of the method disclosed herein. The particular sequence of such executable instructions or associated data structures represent examples of corresponding acts for implementing the functions described in such steps.Embodiments may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by local and remote processing devices that are linked (either by hardwired links, wireless links, or by a combination of hardwired or wireless links) through a communication network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices. The above representation is merely for context and it will be understood that the maintenance system 8 may include any suitable additional components and be utilized in any suitable manner.In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, FIG. 2 illustrates a method 100, which may be used for implementing a maintenance schedule for an aircraft, such as the aircraft 10, with a maintenance system comprising multiple communication terminals located physically about the aircraft and in data communication with each other, such as the maintenance system 8. The method 100 begins at 102 with the maintenance system 8 executing a maintenance software program for a maintenance routine comprising maintenance tests corresponding to components 20 of the aircraft 10. It will be understood that the components 20 may include individual parts of the aircraft 10 and/or systems of the aircraft 10.At 104, the maintenance system 8 may display the maintenance routine on at least one of the multiple communication terminals 40 to define a control terminal. In this manner, the maintenance software program may be executed on a computer in communication with the control terminal and/or one of the other multiple communication terminals 40. By way of non-limiting example, the control terminal may be automatically designated as a specific one of the multiple communication terminals 40. Alternatively, the maintenance system 8 may determine which of the multiple communication terminals 40 should be designated as the control terminal. For example, the control terminal may be determined based on where the communication terminal 40 is located or what user is accessing the communication terminal 40. By way of non-limiting example, the controller 26 may have access to maintenance personnel information including hierarchical information for the maintenance personnel.During the maintenance routine, the maintenance system 8 may assign a maintenance test to a communications terminal 40 that is associated with the corresponding component 20 of the aircraft 10 to define an associated terminal for controlling the execution of the maintenance test, as indicated at 106. For example, by displaying a maintenance test indication on the associated terminal. Assigning the maintenance test may include assigning multiple maintenance tests utilized in the maintenance routine. This may include sequentially assigning each of the maintenance tests such that the maintenance system waits until each is done before the next is assigned. It is contemplated that assigning the maintenance tests by the maintenance system 8 may ensure that only a single communication terminal 40 may control the maintenance routine at any time. This may include limiting access to the maintenance tasks to the communication terminal 40 that is the control terminal. Alternatively, the maintenance system 8 may allow multiple communication terminals 40 to access the maintenance tasks while still only allowing the control terminal to control the maintenance routing at any time. It is also contemplated that the maintenance system may be configured to identifying a user at one or more of the multiple communication terminals. It is contemplated that some users may not have the credentials to complete the maintenance test. In such an instance, it is contemplated that the assigning may only occur when the identified user at the one of the multiple communication terminals 40 satisfies a predetermined privilege requirement. The assigning may include assigning maintenance tests to multiple users at either one or differing communication terminals 40. Further, the assigning may include either assigning maintenance tests to a single user utilizing a single communication terminal 40 or using multiple different communication terminals 40. It also contemplated that the assignment may occur automatically when the communication terminal 40, where a current maintenance task is active, disconnects. If there is no need for the tasks in the maintenance routine to be run sequentially it is contemplated that access to the maintenance system 8 including the maintenance routine may be provided to multiple operators at multiple separate locations at any one time. In implementation, the determinations made may be converted to an algorithm to implement a maintenance schedule or routine. Such an algorithm may be converted to a computer program comprising a set of executable instructions, which may be executed by the controller 26 and/or the multiple communication terminals 40.At 108, upon completion of the maintenance tests, a maintenance routine completion indication may be displayed on the control terminal. It will be understood that the control terminal may be a set location or a location where a specific user is located. It is also contemplated that such a completion indication may be displayed on any number of the other communications terminals 40. While it is contemplated that the indication may be a single indication for the entire maintenance routine, a completion indication may also be provided after each maintenance task within the maintenance routine is finished. Such indications may be provided in any suitable manner.An example will likely prove useful for a fuller understanding. Referring now to FIG. 3, the maintenance system 8 and aircraft 10 are again utilized for explanatory purposes and do not limit the embodiments of the invention. In the example, it is contemplated that a first user is in the cockpit 16 utilizing the flight display 42 and a second user is outside the aircraft 10 using one of the external communication terminals 44. It will be understood that while the applications uses the terms user and maintenance personnel such terms are not meant to be limiting. For example, a pilot, co-pilot, etc., may also be considered maintenance personnel as they may complete tasks within the maintenance routine.In the illustrated example, the first user in the cockpit 16 as part of the maintenance routine may need to run the following maintenance tests: flap checkout and port side elevator alignment. The first maintenance test is the flap checkout and the first user within the cockpit 16 may select the flap check test display using the flight display 42 and may select port flap check. At some point in the test, the test indication on the flight display 42 prompts the first user to inspect the flap state at the flap location. While the first user could certainly leave the cockpit 16 to inspect the flap state, it may be more efficient to assign the task to a user external of the aircraft 10. With this in mind, the first user in the cockpit 16 may select the active session of the second user to hand off test control to as illustrated by arrow 200.The second user may receive control of the assigned maintenance task for the port flap check test because the first user has assigned it. It is contemplated that first user may be an ultimate user that may move to another permissible test or monitor the second user's progress during the test in progress. Alternately, the maintenance system 8 may automatically assign the maintenance task based on the identity of the second user or based on the location of the external communication terminal 44. The second user continues the test in progress and may coordinate with the first user as needed. Upon completion of the port flap check test, the second user or the controller of the maintenance system 8 may assign the routine back to the first user in the cockpit 16, as indicated at 202. The user in the cockpit 16 may take control from the second user or the maintenance system 8 may determine that the second user's test is complete and may hand back control to the first user automatically.The first user may continue with the flap checkout and select the starboard flap check. While the first user is selecting the test, the second user may move to the next location to support the starboard flap test as illustrated at 220. Alternatively, the second user may move to an alternative external communication terminal 44 associated with the starboard flap. At some point in the test, the test display prompts the first user to inspect flap state and flap location. At this point, the first user may assign the maintenance test to the second user or the maintenance system 8 may automatically assign the test as indicated at 204.The second user receives the assigned test and continues to execute the test including coordinating with the first user as needed. Upon completion of the test, the second user may assign the task back to the first user in the cockpit, as indicated at 206. Again, the maintenance system 8 may do this automatically. For example, the maintenance system 8 may determine that the second user's test is complete and may hand back control to the first user. Alternatively, if the first user is an ultimate user, the first user may assign the task back to themselves. In this manner, the ultimate user may take control of the maintenance test from the second user.With the flap check test portion of the maintenance routine complete, the alignment of the port elevator may now take place. It is again contemplated that the second user may move to the next location, as indicated at 222, to support the port elevator test although this need not be the case as an alternate user or alternate communication terminal 40 may be utilized. At some point in the test, the test prompts the first user to inspect the elevator state. At this point, the first user or the maintenance system 8 assigns the test to the second user as indicated at 208. The second user may complete the test and the maintenance system 8 may determine that the maintenance routine is completed and may display a maintenance routine completion on the control terminal. While the above description limits the example to a first user and a second user it will be understood that any number of users may be utilized and that any number of communication terminals 40 may be used. Further, while the above description limits the test related to the alignment of the port elevator to after the flap check test it is contemplated that the two maintenance tests may be executed simultaneously.It will be understood that the method of implementing a maintenance schedule for an aircraft is flexible and the method illustrated is merely for illustrative purposes. For example, the sequence of steps depicted is for illustrative purposes only, and is not meant to limit the method 100 in any way, as it is understood that the steps may proceed in a different logical order or additional or intervening steps may be included without detracting from embodiments of the invention. For example, the method 100 may include determining where the multiple communication terminals 40 are located. In such an instance, the maintenance test may be assigned at 106 to the communications terminal 40 closest to the corresponding component 20. Further still, the assigning the maintenance test, at 106, may be in response to a user input and the method 100 may include receiving a user input and/or determining that a user input has been received. Further still, the method may include determining whether a maintenance test is available for a user at one of the multiple communication terminals 40. This may include that the controller 26 may determine whether a user is logged into the communication terminal 40 and/or whether the user logged into the communication terminal has permission to access the maintenance test.In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, FIG. 4 illustrates a method 300, which may be used for management of a maintenance routine for an aircraft, such as the aircraft 10, with a maintenance system comprising multiple communication terminals located physically about the aircraft and in data communication with each other, such as the maintenance system 8. The method 300 is similar to the method 100 previously described. It will be understood that the description of the like parts of the method 100 applies to the method 300, unless otherwise noted. Similarities include that at 302 the maintenance system 8 may execute a maintenance software program for a maintenance routine comprising maintenance tests corresponding to components 20 of the aircraft 10 and that a maintenance test may be assigned to a communications terminal associated with a corresponding component to define an associated terminal for controlling the execution of the maintenance test by displaying a maintenance test indication on the associated terminal as indicated at 306.At 304, the maintenance system 8 may define an ultimate user. The ultimate user may be defined in any suitable manner including that the ultimate user may be defined based on a predetermined hierarchy of multiple users, based on one of the location of the user or the identity of the user, etc. For example, the maintenance system 8 may define a pilot as the ultimate user based on the pilot's location in the cockpit or based on a unique ID for the pilot.In the method of management 300, the ultimate user may override the assignment of the maintenance test as assigned at 306 or may end the maintenance routine before completion of the maintenance test as assigned at 306. Overriding the assignment may include allowing the ultimate user to control a maintenance test being executed by a different user, allowing the ultimate user to oversee a maintenance test being executed by a different user, allowing the ultimate user to modify a maintenance test being executed by a different user, allowing the ultimate user to end access to the associated terminal for a different user, etc. For example, if the ultimate user is a pilot and the pilot wishes to fly the aircraft without waiting for the completion of the maintenance routine the pilot may mark the maintenance task complete, finish the maintenance task himself, or simply end the maintenance routine.It will be understood that the method for management of a maintenance routine for an aircraft is flexible and the method illustrated is merely for illustrative purposes. For example, the sequence of steps depicted is for illustrative purposes only, and is not meant to limit the method 300 in any way, as it is understood that the steps may proceed in a different logical order or additional or intervening steps may be included without detracting from embodiments of the invention. Further, it is contemplated that the assigning of the maintenance test may also utilize the predetermined hierarchy of multiple users in determining which user or communication terminal to make the assignment to. Further, the method 300 may also include displaying the maintenance routine on a communication terminal being utilized by the ultimate user including displaying any completion indications of maintenance tasks or the maintenance routine.Aircraft maintenance may require many steps. In order to complete a maintenance routine it may be necessary to distribute various maintenance tasks among many resources. Technical effects of the above-described embodiments include that portions of a maintenance routine may be assigned and controlled by a maintenance system. Including that portions of the maintenance routine may be transferred between the aircraft and communication terminal(s) that are external of the aircraft. The above-described embodiments provide for management of the maintenance tasks between multiple users and/or multiple terminals. The above-described embodiments allow for many maintainers to coordinate efforts across multiple users based upon permissions of that user and/or the user's location and may allow for an assignment of the immediate session to be resumed at a different terminal. This allows maintenance routines to be completed more efficiently and minimizes the time aircraft are grounded. The above-described embodiments may also allow for a reduced maintenance force than typically required to perform complicated multi-location on the same vehicle maintenance tasks. Further, the above-described embodiments allow a centrally located maintainer to coordinate maintenance tasks between multiple maintainers similarly located or dispersed to different areas of the aircraft.To the extent not already described, the different features and structures of the various embodiments may be used in combination with each other as desired. That one feature may not be illustrated in all of the embodiments is not meant to be construed that it may not be, but is done for brevity of description.

The method or system encompasses different components of the aircraft maintenance domain and meets the requirements of multiple stakeholders each seeking a customized record of aircraft maintenance application data. The method or system is also capable of expansion to support future requirements.Embodiments of the subject matter described herein relate generally to methods for generating vehicle health maintenance data and, more particularly, to the preparation of aircraft maintenance application data for retrieval by portable devices.Aircraft maintenance data typically results from monitoring and recording upward of eight thousand different aircraft parameters while an aircraft is in service. The aircraft maintenance data may be collected for individual parts, subsystems, or for entire systems, and is utilized by various applications for activities such as scheduling aircraft maintenance, providing insight into performance, and troubleshooting (prognostics). Often referred to as “vehicle health management,” or an onboard maintenance system (OMS), the collection and recording of aircraft maintenance data is typically centrally managed by an onboard software program that compiles, sorts, and distributes the aircraft maintenance data for use by one or more stakeholders.Interested avionics stakeholders, such as suppliers of parts, vehicle fleet operators, original equipment manufacturers (OEM), and military and research personnel, are increasingly switching to portable devices to reap the benefits of quick turnaround and customizability. Decreasing costs and increasing reliability has also driven the proliferation of portable devices into a wide range of applications in various segments of the aerospace domain. Many existing aircraft applications are being transferred from traditional centrally managed aircraft maintenance platforms to a plurality of portable devices, causing interface and efficiency issues with existing centralized hardware; in particular, traditional methods for delivering aircraft maintenance application data from the centralized hardware/software to a plurality of portable devices is inefficient.Consequently, an innovative method or system capable of preparing aircraft maintenance application data for retrieval by portable devices is desired. The desired method or system encompasses different components of the aircraft maintenance domain and meets the requirements of the multiple stakeholders. In addition, the desired method or system is capable of expansion to support future requirements.This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description section.

Such operations, tasks, and functions are sometimes referred to as being computer-executed, computerized, software-implemented, or computer-implemented. In practice, one or more processor devices can carry out the described operations, tasks, and functions by manipulating electrical signals representing data bits at memory locations in the system memory, as well as other processing of signals. The memory locations where data bits are maintained are physical locations that have particular electrical, magnetic, optical, or organic properties corresponding to the data bits. It should be appreciated that the various block components shown in the figures may be realized by any number of hardware, software, and/or firmware components configured to perform the specified functions. For example, an embodiment of a system or a component may employ various integrated circuit components, e.g., memory elements, digital signal processing elements, logic elements, look-up tables, or the like, which may carry out a variety of functions under the control of one or more microprocessors or other control devices.The following descriptions may refer to elements or nodes or features being “coupled” together. As used herein, unless expressly stated otherwise, “coupled” means that one element/node/feature is directly or indirectly joined to (or directly or indirectly communicates with) another element/node/feature, and not necessarily mechanically. Thus, although the drawings may depict one exemplary arrangement of elements, additional intervening elements, devices, features, or components may be present in an embodiment of the depicted subject matter. In addition, certain terminology may also be used in the following description for the purpose of reference only, and thus are not intended to be limiting.The embodiment described herein is merely an example and serves as a guide for implementing the novel systems and method herein on any vehicle in any industrial, commercial, military, or consumer application. As such, the examples presented herein are intended as non-limiting.FIG. 1 is a simplified illustration of an aircraft, a portable device, and a ground base station arranged according to an exemplary embodiment. Aircraft 100 includes a central maintenance computer 102. The central maintenance computer 102 is configurable to be coupled via a ground line 106 to the ground base station 104. The central maintenance computer 102 is also coupled to a portable device 110 via wireless communication. Portable devices typically communicate wirelessly, and include an onboard processor and memory. Often, a portable device also has an option to connect via a hard wire connection if the wireless signal is weak or causes a security concern. Portable devices vary in size, including examples such as, hand-held devices, devices contained in a backpack or brief case, and devices that sit on wheels or reside within a structure.For simplifying purposes, only one portable device 110 and one ground base station 104 are shown in FIG. 1. In practice, there may be multiple portable devices and multiple ground base stations, in multiple locations. The ground base station 104 may be a maintenance terminal where ground base station tools are employed. Alternatively, ground base station 104 may be a remote device that has been coupled to the aircraft by way of ground line 106. As used herein, either ground base station 104 or portable device 110 may retrieve aircraft maintenance application data from the aircraft 100.Each portable device 110 and each ground base station 104 is typically representative of a single stakeholder. A stakeholder includes airline, aircraft OEMs, suppliers of parts, vehicle fleet operators, military and research personnel, or similar interested parties. Each stakeholder may individually communicate with the aircraft, typically by utilizing a security protocol. Each stakeholder individually retrieves a customized maintenance application data record from the aircraft 100.Wireless communication includes communication with portable devices such as portable device 110, as well as aircraft communications addressing and reporting system (ACARS), satellite, and similar means of wireless transmissions. Retrieval of maintenance application data records is typically done at the completion of aircraft flight operations, or at the end of aircraft service. Retrieval of records may be achieved via a ground line 106, or via wireless communication; wireless communication is supported at any time during aircraft service.FIG. 2 is a system level block diagram of the central maintenance computer 102 suitable for preparing aircraft maintenance application data for retrieval via a remote device, according to an exemplary embodiment. Central maintenance computer 102 includes processor 202 and memory 204. Sensors 206, ground communication 208, wireless communication, and avionics data link 210, each supply aircraft data and information to the central maintenance computer 102. As described in association with FIG. 1, communication of data and information between the aircraft and stakeholders external to the aircraft may be transmitted wirelessly or via a ground line; in some embodiments communication is also achieved via a CD, hard disk, USB stick, shop loader device, or similar device.The processor 202 may be implemented or realized with at least one general purpose processor, a content addressable memory, a digital signal processor, an application specific integrated circuit, a field programmable gate array, any suitable programmable logic device, discrete gate or transistor logic, discrete hardware components, or any combination designed to perform the functions described herein. A processor device may be realized as a microprocessor, a microcontroller, or a state machine. Moreover, a processor device may be implemented as a combination of computing devices, e.g., a combination of a digital signal processor and a microprocessor, a plurality of microprocessors, one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a digital signal processor core, or any other such configuration.The processor 202 may include or cooperate with an appropriate amount of memory (for example memory 204), which can be realized as RAM memory, flash memory, EPROM memory, EEPROM memory, registers, a hard disk, a removable disk, a CD-ROM, or any other form of storage medium known in the art. In this regard, the memory can be coupled to the processor such that the processor can read information from, and write information to, the memory. In the alternative, the memory may be integral to the processor. In practice, a functional or logical module/component of the system described here might be realized using program code that is maintained in the memory, or in separately located memory. Moreover, the memory can be used to store data utilized to support the operation of the system, as will become apparent from the following description.In practice, the processor 202 may be realized as an onboard component of a vehicle (e.g., an onboard management system, central maintenance computer, a flight deck control system, a flight management system, or the like), or it may be realized in a portable computing device that is carried onboard the vehicle. For example, the processor 202 could be realized as the central processing unit (CPU) of a laptop computer, a tablet computer, or a handheld device. No matter how processor 202 is specifically implemented, it is in operable communication with one or more remote devices (for example, portable device 110 and ground base station 104 in FIG. 1) when an aircraft maintenance application record is retrieved by a stakeholder.Sensors 206 include devices, instruments, and software for detecting status, temperature, faults, condition or any other aircraft subsystem or environmental data. The avionics data link 210 is a communication media having a bandwidth and sequencing protocol that allows transmission of data between electronic subsystems onboard the aircraft as well as aircraft to ground exchange of data.The sensors 206, ground communication 208, avionics data link 210, and wireless communication may all contribute to the specification of or generation of raw data that will be stored in the central maintenance computer (CMC). Non-limiting examples of raw data include fault history data sets, maintenance reports, maintenance memos that have been entered by the pilot or crew, aircraft configuration data, and data/health dumps from various line replacement units (LRU). When the vehicle is in service, the embodiment concurrently collects and records, in the CMC, multivariant parametric data as raw data. The raw data forms the basis of the aircraft maintenance application data that is retrieved by stakeholders using portable devices.The exemplary embodiment provides a framework for preparing aircraft maintenance application data for retrieval by portable devices in four layers, but the functionality may be supported by other arrangements as well. The functionality of the four layers of the exemplary embodiment is as follows. Raw data is copied from its resident location in the CMC to the first layer 212, the CMC raw data layer, where it is utilized by the other layers. In a second layer 214, the data analyzer and prognostic builder layer, the raw data from the first layer 212 is inspected and analyzed, and prognostics are developed for LRUs. In a third layer 216, the application specific data generation and transmission layer, data from the second layer 214 is collated and organized to generate maintenance application data records. In the fourth layer 218, the application specific data configuration layer, maintenance application data records generated in the third layer 216 are configured to meet stakeholder requirements. The fourth layer 218 can be tuned and designed based on one or more stakeholder's requirements. More detail regarding the operations that occur in each layer is provided in connection with FIG. 3.In the exemplary embodiment, multiple customized maintenance application data records are generated concurrently. It is readily appreciated that various stakeholders may have some redundancy between them with respect to some or all of the maintenance application data records that they request. Any redundancy is readily handled by this embodiment, as it concurrently populates the associated maintenance application data records.FIG. 3 is a flow chart 300 describing steps of preparing aircraft maintenance application data for retrieval via a remote device, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. The various steps are exemplary; additional steps may be added, and steps may be arranged in a different order. When the aircraft is in service, which is defined as including taxi operations, take-off operations, cruise operations, and landing operations, the parametric raw data is collected for various subsystems and LRUs and stored within the CMC memory 204. Raw data may include any of the thousands of available data parameters (representing, for example, onboard instruments and equipment, line replacement units (LRU), altitude, temperature, operating speed, engine thrust, and the like.The CMC raw data is collected from CMC memory 204 and moved into a first layer 212 for use by the other layers at STEP 302. In STEP 304, the raw data is analyzed. The data analysis step inspects the raw data, and identifies predictive patterns in the raw data. The identified predictive patterns are indicators of a health or performance issue of a subsystem. For simplifying purposes, “subsystem” is defined herein to include one or more of: individual parts, aircraft subsystems, an entire aircraft system, or a line replacement unit (LRU). The identified predictive patterns are used to perform further diagnostics of the existing subsystem(s) issues and to generate an error recovery mechanism for each subsystem issue. In STEP 306, a prognostic data report for the one or more subsystems or LRUs is built. In the exemplary embodiment, STEP 304 and STEP 306 occur in the second layer 214.In STEP 308, the prognostic data report generated in STEP 306 is collated into maintenance application data records for specific applications that satisfy the requests or interests of specific stakeholders. The exemplary embodiment provides modularization in this manner. Applications that can be built to satisfy the requests or interests of specific stakeholders such as operators, OEMs, suppliers, or end users, include, but are not limited to: fault identification and repair information, for example, to perform cascade effect removal, fault consolidation, fault isolation and/or fault correlation; data loading; fault history; initiated/interactive tests (tests which can be manually initiated or require human interactions or observations), input monitoring; configuration reporting; shop faults; and report generation, for example, to save reports to a disk, or print or send via a data link to a destination).At STEP 312 a stakeholder retrieves the configured and customized maintenance application data record. The configuration and tuning takes into account native platform needs such as the target system architecture (CPU, memory, etc.), operating system and interfaces, and supports multiple stakeholders, for example, the pilot, OEMs, and suppliers. The exemplary embodiment enables concurrently customizing multiple maintenance application data records that include the stakeholder-relevant aircraft maintenance data.At STEP 312 the configured and customized maintenance application data record is retrieved by a stakeholder. As described hereinabove, the stakeholder may access the record via a ground line (e.g., ground line 106) or wirelessly (e.g., wireless communication). The stakeholder may be in a remote location and is typically utilizing a portable or mobile device (e.g., portable device 110).Thus, there has been provided a method and system for preparing aircraft maintenance application data for retrieval by portable devices. The exemplary embodiment is capable of expansion to support future requirements; such expansion may be the type of information made available to the stakeholder and the processing and presentation of the information.While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in the foregoing detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast number of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary embodiment or embodiments described herein are not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the claimed subject matter in any way.

US09522746-20161220.XML	Apparatus and methods for attitude control of a space vehicle. The space vehicle includes a reaction wheel subsystem and a propulsion subsystem for attitude control. A slew controller for the space vehicle detects a failure of the reaction wheel subsystem. To perform an attitude slew, the slew controller identifies a pair of thrusters in the propulsion subsystem that will rotate the space vehicle about a desired axis. The slew controller determines burn parameters for the pair of thrusters, and initiates the burns to perform the desired attitude slew.This disclosure relates to the field of space vehicles, and more particularly, to attitude control for space vehicles.Satellites or other space vehicles are configured to orbit around a planet, such as the Earth, for a variety of purposes, such as communications, exploration, etc. For example, a geosynchronous satellite is a satellite that orbits the Earth and follows the direction of the Earth's rotation. One revolution of a geosynchronous satellite around the Earth takes about 24 hours, which is the same amount of time it takes for the Earth to rotate once about its axis. These types of satellites are considered geosynchronous because they appear stationary when viewed from a particular location on the Earth, and are commonly used as communication satellites.When a satellite is in orbit, systems onboard the satellite are able to control the orientation of the satellite in relation to a planet, which is referred to as attitude control. For example, attitude control systems are able to control the orientation of a satellite so that instruments (e.g., antennas, telescopes, cameras, etc.) onboard the satellite point in a desired direction.Traditional satellites use chemical thrusters (e.g., bipropellant) and/or reaction wheels for attitude control. A reaction wheel uses a spinning mass with a substantial amount of inertia. The spinning mass of the reaction wheel applies torque along an axis of the satellite causing a rotation of the satellite along that axis. Installation of a reaction wheel along three axes of the satellite, for example, allows systems to control the rotation of the satellite along all three axes. The chemical thrusters may be used to assist the reaction wheels in attitude control.It is desirable to identify new and improved ways for controlling the attitude of space vehicles.Embodiments described herein provide attitude control for a space vehicle with a low-thrust propulsion subsystem. Even when space vehicles are equipped with reaction wheels for attitude control, there may be scenarios where one or more of the reaction wheels fail such that attitude control along three axes is not possible with the remaining reaction wheel(s). Upon failure of one or more reaction wheels, a low-thrust propulsion subsystem is used for attitude control so that the space vehicle may remain in service.One embodiment comprises a space vehicle that includes a bus having a nadir side and a zenith side opposite the nadir side, a reaction wheel subsystem that includes a plurality of reaction wheels for controlling attitude of the space vehicle, and a propulsion subsystem that includes a plurality of thrusters installed on the zenith side of the bus each having a thrust less than 0.1 Newton. Each of the thrusters is coupled to the bus by a two-axis gimbal assembly. The space vehicle further comprises a slew controller coupled to the reaction wheel subsystem and the propulsion subsystem. The slew controller is configured to detect a failure in the reaction wheel subsystem. In response to the failure, the slew controller is configured to determine a target attitude for the space vehicle, identify a first thruster and a second thruster of the plurality of thrusters that produce an attitude slew of the space vehicle about an axis toward the target attitude, determine start parameters for the first thruster and the second thruster to initiate the attitude slew about the axis, direct the first thruster at first gimbal angles based on the start parameters so that thruster forces from the first thruster are spaced by a first moment arm from a center of mass of the space vehicle, direct the second thruster at second gimbal angles based on the start parameters so that thruster forces from the second thruster are spaced by a second moment arm from the center of mass, initiate a burn of the first thruster for a first burn duration based on the start parameters, and initiate a burn of the second thruster for a second burn duration based on the start parameters.In another embodiment, the slew controller is configured to determine the start parameters by determining a slew rate for the attitude slew, determining a target momentum change of the space vehicle based on the slew rate, setting the first burn duration of the first thruster and the second burn duration of the second thruster at a minimum, setting the first gimbal angles of the first thruster and the second gimbal angles of the second thruster to produce thrust through the center of mass, and performing an iterative process. The iterative process includes determining an iteration momentum change of the space vehicle based on the first burn duration and the first gimbal angles of the first thruster and based on the second burn duration and the second gimbal angles of the second thruster, comparing the iteration momentum change to the target momentum change, using the first burn duration and the first gimbal angles of the first thruster, and the second burn duration and the second gimbal angles of the second thruster as the start parameters when a difference between the iteration momentum change and the target momentum change is less than a threshold, and adjusting the first gimbal angles of the first thruster and the second gimbal angles of the second thruster when the difference between the iteration momentum change and the target momentum change is greater than the threshold.In another embodiment, the slew controller is configured to determine the start parameters by increasing the first burn duration of the first thruster and the second burn duration of the second thruster when the difference between the iteration momentum change and the target momentum change is greater than the threshold and the first gimbal angles or the second gimbal angles exceed an operational range, setting the first gimbal angles of the first thruster and the second gimbal angles of the second thruster to produce thrust through the center of mass, and repeating the iterative process.In another embodiment, the slew controller is configured to determine the iteration momentum change of the space vehicle using:

{right arrow over (h)}b=t1({right arrow over (r)}1b×{right arrow over (f)}1b)+t2({right arrow over (r)}2b×{right arrow over (f)}2b)
where t1 is the first burn duration of the first thruster, t2 is the second burn duration of the second thruster, {right arrow over (f)}1b is a force vector for the first thruster, {right arrow over (r)}1b is a moment arm vector between the force vector for the first thruster and the center of mass, {right arrow over (f)}2b is a force vector for the second thruster, and {right arrow over (r)}2b is a moment arm vector between the force vector for the second thruster and the center of mass.In another embodiment, the slew controller is configured to relate the force vector and the moment arm vector for the first thruster to the first gimbal angles for the first thruster, and to relate the force vector and the moment arm vector for the second thruster to the second gimbal angles for the second thruster.In another embodiment, the slew controller is configured to determine the start parameters with the iterative process based on a constraint that:

t1{right arrow over (f)}1o=t2{right arrow over (f)}2o=0.
In another embodiment, the slew controller is configured to determine a drift duration where the space vehicle rotates about the axis at a constant rate, and allow the space vehicle to drift for the drift duration.In another embodiment, the slew controller is configured to determine stop parameters for the first thruster and the second thruster to stop the attitude slew after the drift duration to achieve the target attitude, direct the first thruster at third gimbal angles based on the stop parameters so that the thruster forces from the first thruster are spaced by a third moment arm from the center of mass, direct the second thruster at fourth gimbal angles based on the stop parameters so that the thruster forces from the second thruster are spaced by a fourth moment arm from the center of mass, initiate a burn of the first thruster for a third burn duration based on the stop parameters, and initiate a burn of the second thruster for a fourth burn duration based on the stop parameters.In another embodiment, the slew controller is configured to determine the stop parameters by determining a target momentum change of the space vehicle, setting the third burn duration of the first thruster and the fourth burn duration of the second thruster at a minimum, setting the third gimbal angles of the first thruster and the fourth gimbal angles of the second thruster to produce thrust through the center of mass, and performing an iterative process. The iterative process includes determining an iteration momentum change of the space vehicle based on the third burn duration and the third gimbal angles of the first thruster and based on the fourth burn duration and the fourth gimbal angles of the second thruster, comparing the iteration momentum change to the target momentum change, using the third burn duration and the third gimbal angles of the first thruster, and the fourth burn duration and the fourth gimbal angles of the second thruster as the stop parameters when a difference between the iteration momentum change and the target momentum change is less than a threshold, and adjusting the third gimbal angles of the first thruster and the fourth gimbal angles of the second thruster when the difference between the iteration momentum change and the target momentum change is greater than the threshold.In another embodiment, the slew controller is configured to determine the stop parameters by increasing the third burn duration of the first thruster and the fourth burn duration of the second thruster when the difference between the iteration momentum change and the target momentum change is greater than the threshold and the third gimbal angles or the fourth gimbal angles exceed an operational range, setting the third gimbal angles of the first thruster and the fourth gimbal angles of the second thruster to produce thrust through the center of mass, and repeating the iterative process.In another embodiment, the plurality of thrusters includes a northwest thruster, a northeast thruster, a southwest thruster, and a southeast thruster installed on the zenith side of the bus.In another embodiment, the thrusters comprise electric thrusters, such as thrusters that use xenon as a propellant.The features, functions, and advantages that have been discussed can be achieved independently in various embodiments or may be combined in yet other embodiments, further details of which can be seen with reference to the following description and drawings.Some embodiments of the present invention are now described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings.

It will be appreciated that those skilled in the art will be able to devise various arrangements that, although not explicitly described or shown herein, embody the principles described herein and are included within the contemplated scope of the claims that follow this description. Furthermore, any examples described herein are intended to aid in understanding the principles of the disclosure, and are to be construed as being without limitation. As a result, this disclosure is not limited to the specific embodiments or examples described below, but by the claims and their equivalents.FIG. 1 illustrates a satellite 100 in an exemplary embodiment. Although the term “satellite” is used herein, the embodiments described below apply to any type of space vehicle. Satellite 100 includes a main body frame that carries a payload, which is referred to as a bus 102. When viewed from the Earth or another primary body, bus 102 includes a nadir side 104 (i.e., front side) and an opposing zenith side 105 (i.e., back side or anti-nadir side). The terms “side” or “face” may be used interchangeably when discussing bus 102. Satellite 100 also includes solar wings 108-109 that are attached to bus 102, and may be used to derive electricity from the Sun to power different components on satellite 100. Satellite 100 also includes instruments or subsystems, such as one or more antennas 112 that may be used for communications. The structure of satellite 100 shown in FIG. 1 is an example, and may vary as desired.Satellite 100 is configured to orbit around a primary body, such as the Earth. For example, satellite 100 may comprise a geosynchronous satellite that orbits the Earth and follows the direction of the Earth's rotation. In order to control its attitude, satellite 100 includes an attitude control system. FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of an attitude control system 200 in an exemplary embodiment. Attitude control system 200 includes a reaction wheel subsystem 202 and a propulsion subsystem 212. Reaction wheel subsystem 202 is a system that uses a plurality of reaction wheels 204 that are able to alter the orientation or attitude of satellite 100. FIG. 3 illustrates a subsystem that includes a plurality of reaction wheels. A reaction wheel 204 is installed along an x-axis, a y-axis, and a z-axis of the body shown in FIG. 3. Each of the reaction wheels 204 is able to spin in a desired direction to impart rotation along its corresponding axis. A reaction wheel subsystem such as this may be implemented in satellite 100, however the structure of the reaction wheel subsystem or the number of reaction wheels used in the subsystem for satellite 100 is not limited to the structure shown in FIG. 3. For example, redundant reaction wheels may be implemented along each axis in other embodiments. Also, reaction wheels may be implemented in a tetrahedron configuration or another configuration in other embodiments.In FIG. 2, propulsion subsystem 212 is a system that uses a plurality of thrusters 214-217 to alter the orientation or attitude of satellite 100. Each of thrusters 214-217 is referred to herein as “low-thrust”, which means they produce thrust that is less than 0.1 Newton. Thrusters 214-217 may comprise electric thrusters, which are a type of thruster that produces electric thrust by accelerating ions. In a typical electric thruster, a propellant (e.g., xenon) is injected into an ionization chamber and ionized by electron bombardment. The ions are then accelerated by an electromagnetic field, and emitted from the thruster as exhaust that produces thrust. One example of an electric thruster is a Xenon Ion Propulsion System (XIPS©) manufactured by L-3 Communications of Aurora, Colo. Thrusters 214-217 may alternatively comprise quantum vacuum thrusters (with a thrust level of 1000-4000 micro Newton), or pulsed plasma thrusters (with a thrust level of 860 micro Newton). Thrusters 214-217 may alternatively comprise chemical thrusters. A chemical thruster is a type of thruster that burns liquid propellant to produce thrust. One type of chemical thruster is referred to as a bipropellant (or biprop) thruster that burns a liquid fuel and a liquid oxidizer in a combustion chamber. A chemical thruster may be used for thrusters 214-217 as long as the thrust is less than 0.1 Newton.FIG. 4 illustrates propulsion subsystem 212 in an exemplary embodiment. The view in FIG. 4 is of the zenith side 105 of satellite bus 102. The top side of bus 102 is referred to as the north side (indicated by “N”), and the bottom side of bus 102 is referred to as the south side (indicated by “5”). The left side of bus 102 in FIG. 4 is referred to as the west side (indicated by “W”), and the right side of bus 102 in FIG. 4 is referred to as the east side (indicated by “E”). The zenith side 105 of bus 102 includes thrusters 214-217 that are part of propulsion subsystem 212.Thrusters 214-217 are respectively positioned in northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast regions of zenith side 105 in this embodiment. Each thruster 214-217 is coupled to bus 102 by a gimbal assembly. For example, northwest thruster 214 is coupled to bus 102 by gimbal assembly 414, northeast thruster 215 is coupled to bus 102 by gimbal assembly 415, southwest thruster 216 is coupled to bus 102 by gimbal assembly 416, and southeast thruster 217 is coupled to bus 102 by gimbal assembly 417. Each gimbal assembly 414-417 is configured to pivot along two axes to alter the thrust vector of its corresponding thruster 214-217. The gimbal angles for each gimbal assembly are referred to herein as ρ and γ. Although not specifically shown in FIG. 4, gimbal assemblies 414-417 may include gimbals or gimbal units, rotary motors that control movement of the gimbals, and rotary encoders that determine the mechanical position of the gimbals.The number or positions of thrusters 214-217 as shown in FIG. 4 provide an exemplary configuration, and other thruster configurations may be used in other embodiments. Also, other thrusters may be used on satellite 100 for stationkeeping maneuvers that are not illustrated in FIG. 4.FIG. 5 illustrates the thrust lines of thrusters 214-217 for propulsion subsystem 212 in an exemplary embodiment. Thrust line 514 represents the direction of thrust forces produced by thruster 214. Thrust line 515 represents the direction of thrust forces produced by thruster 215. Thrust line 516 represents the direction of thrust forces produced by thruster 216. Thrust line 517 represents the direction of thrust forces produced by thruster 217. The thrust lines for each thruster 214-217 may be altered from what is shown in FIG. 5 because thrusters 214-217 are gimballed. To alter the attitude of satellite 100, thrusters 214-217 can be directed so that their thrust lines are spaced by moment arms from the center of mass 540 of satellite 100. For instance, thrust line 514 is spaced from center of mass 540 by moment arm 524, thrust line 515 is spaced from center of mass 540 by moment arm 525, thrust line 516 is spaced from center of mass 540 by moment arm 526, and thrust line 517 is spaced from center of mass 540 by moment arm 527. A thruster 214-217 directed to have a moment arm R and generating a force F can induce a torque T in satellite 100 (i.e., T=R×F). Therefore, the attitude of satellite 100 may be controlled based on the moment arms and the force (or amount of thrust) of thrusters 214-217. To apply torques to satellite 100 for attitude control, each of thrusters 214-217 can be redirected to form a moment arm with the satellite's center of mass 540.Attitude control system 200 as shown in FIG. 2 also includes a slew controller 222 that is coupled to reaction wheel subsystem 202 and propulsion subsystem 212. Slew controller 222 comprises devices, components, or modules (including hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software) that control the orientation or attitude of satellite 100. Slew controller 222 may be located on Earth, and able to communicate with reaction wheel subsystem 202 and/or propulsion subsystem 212 via wireless signals. Slew controller 222 may alternatively be located on satellite 100. Slew controller 222 may alternatively be modularized with a portion of slew controller 222 located on Earth, and a portion located locally on satellite 100.FIG. 6 illustrates satellite 100 in an orbit in an exemplary embodiment. The attitude of satellite 100 may be defined with reference to a coordinate system having a roll axis 602, a pitch axis 603, and a yaw axis 604. Pitch axis 603 is orthogonal to the orbit plane 610 of satellite 100, yaw axis 604 is directed at the planet (e.g., Earth) 612 around which satellite 100 is orbiting, and roll axis 602 is orthogonal to the other two axes.Slew controller 222 (see FIG. 2) communicates with reaction wheel subsystem 202 and propulsion subsystem 212 to control the attitude of satellite. As part of attitude control, slew controller 222 may implement any combination of maneuvers with reaction wheel subsystem 202 and propulsion subsystem 212. There may be instances where one or more of reaction wheels 204 become inoperable so that reaction wheel subsystem 202 can no longer perform attitude control. When a failure occurs, slew controller 222 may solely use propulsion subsystem 212 for attitude control so that satellite 100 may remain in service. For attitude control with propulsion subsystem 212, slew controller 222 performs a maneuver with a pair of thrusters 214-217 to initiate a slew of satellite 100 about an axis toward a target attitude. The satellite 100 will then drift (i.e., rotate) about the axis toward the target attitude. Slew controller 222 then performs another maneuver with the pair of thrusters 214-217 to stop the slew at the target attitude.FIGS. 7-8 are flow charts illustrating a method 700 for attitude control using propulsion subsystem 212 in an exemplary embodiment. The steps of method 700 will be described with respect to satellite 100, although one skilled in the art will understand that the methods described herein may be performed for other satellites or systems not shown. The steps of the methods described herein are not all inclusive and may include other steps not shown. The steps for the flow charts shown herein may also be performed in an alternative order.Slew controller 222 detects a failure in reaction wheel subsystem 202 (step 702). A failure in reaction wheel subsystem 202 may comprise a failure of one or more of the reaction wheels 204 that render reaction wheel subsystem 202 unable to perform attitude control. In response to the failure, slew controller 222 uses propulsion subsystem 212 for attitude control. To perform attitude control, slew controller 222 determines a target attitude for satellite 100 (step 704), which is the target orientation of satellite 100 in relation to a primary body (e.g., the Earth). For example, the target attitude for satellite 100 may be positive 90° along the pitch axis (see axis 603 in FIG. 6).Slew controller 222 identifies a pair of thrusters (e.g., a first thruster and a second thruster) in propulsion subsystem 212 that produce an attitude slew of satellite 100 about an axis to toward the target attitude (step 706). To slew satellite 100 about the pitch axis, for example, a northwest-southwest pair of thrusters may be used, or a northeast-southeast pair of thrusters may be used (see FIGS. 5-6). Slew controller 222 determines start parameters for the pair of thrusters to initiate or begin the attitude slew (step 708 in FIG. 7). The start parameters may include a burn duration and gimbal angles for each of the thrusters being used in this maneuver to initiate the attitude slew. For instance, the start parameters may include first gimbal angles and a first burn duration for a first thruster of the pair, and second gimbal angles and a second burn duration for a second thruster of the pair. One way to determine the start parameters is with an iterative process or algorithm that is described in more detail below.Based on the start parameters, slew controller 222 directs the first thruster at the first gimbal angles so that thruster forces from the first thruster are spaced by a moment arm from the center of mass 540 of satellite 100 (step 710). To direct the first thruster, slew controller 222 controls the gimbal assembly for the first thruster to orient the first thruster according to the first gimbal angles. Slew controller 222 also directs the second thruster at the second gimbal angles so that thruster forces from the second thruster are spaced by a moment arm from the center of mass 540 of satellite 100 (step 712). To direct the second thruster, slew controller 222 controls the gimbal assembly for the second thruster to orient the second thruster according to the second gimbal angles. The moment arms formed by the thruster forces act to rotate satellite 100 about the desired axis. Slew controller 222 then initiates a burn of the first thruster for a first burn duration, and initiates a burn of the second thruster for a second burn duration (step 714).The burns of the first thruster and the second thruster cause an angular momentum change about the desired axis toward the target attitude. Slew controller 222 also determines a drift duration where satellite 100 rotates about the axis toward the target attitude at a constant rate (step 716). Responsive to the initial maneuver to cause a momentum change, satellite 100 will rotate about the axis at a slew rate (i.e., angular velocity). The time that satellite 100 rotates about the axis at the slew rate is referred to herein as the drift duration. Slew controller 222 allows satellite 100 to drift (rotational drift as opposed to linear drift) at the constant rate for the drift duration (step 718 in FIG. 8).In order to stop or decelerate the rotation of satellite 100 at or near the target attitude, slew controller 222 initiates another maneuver with the pair of thrusters (see FIG. 8). For this maneuver, slew controller 222 determines stop parameters for the pair of thrusters to decelerate or stop the attitude slew of satellite 100 (step 720). The same pair of thrusters is used to stop the attitude slew as was used to start the attitude slew. The stop parameters may include a burn duration and gimbal angles for each of the thrusters being used in this maneuver to stop the attitude slew. For instance, the stop parameters may include third gimbal angles and a third burn duration for the first thruster of the pair, and fourth gimbal angles and a fourth burn duration for the second thruster of the pair.Based on the stop parameters, slew controller 222 directs the first thruster at the third gimbal angles so that thruster forces from the first thruster are spaced by a moment arm from the center of mass 540 of satellite 100 (step 722). Slew controller 222 also directs the second thruster at the fourth gimbal angles so that thruster forces from the second thruster are spaced by a moment arm from the center of mass 540 of satellite 100 (step 724). Slew controller 222 then initiates a burn of the first thruster for a third burn duration, and initiates a burn of the second thruster for a fourth burn duration (step 726). The maneuver based on the stop parameters counteracts the rotation of satellite 100 so that the slew stops at or near the target attitude.The maneuvers of propulsion subsystem 212 are able to slew satellite 100 about any axis so that attitude control may be maintained even when reaction wheel subsystem 202 fails. Also, the thrusters 214-217 used in these maneuvers are low-thrust so that the maneuvers can be performed with a limited amount of fuel. Therefore, satellite 100 can advantageously stay in service for an extended period of time after failure of reaction wheel subsystem 202.In one embodiment, slew controller 222 may determine the start parameters and/or stop parameters for the attitude slew based on an iterative process. The following describes an exemplary iterative process for determining the parameters. To determine the parameters for a maneuver with a pair of thrusters, slew controller 222 first determines a slew rate for the maneuver to achieve the target attitude. Slew controller 222 can then determine a target momentum change for satellite 100 based on the slew rate and the moment of inertia of satellite 100.Slew controller 222 may then use the iterative process to approximate a momentum change (referred to herein as an iteration momentum change) as the burn durations and gimbal angles of the pair of thrusters are adjusted. An equation used to predict the momentum change {right arrow over (h)}b when a pair of thrusters are fired is given by:

t1({right arrow over (r)}1b×{right arrow over (f)}1b)+t2({right arrow over (r)}2b×{right arrow over (f)}2b)={right arrow over (h)}b  (1)
where t1 and t2 are the burn durations, {right arrow over (r)}b and {right arrow over (r)}2b are the moment arm vectors in the body frame, and {right arrow over (f)}1b and {right arrow over (f)}2b are force vectors in the body frame due to two thrusters firing. The moment arms {right arrow over (r)}1b and {right arrow over (r)}2b, and force vectors {right arrow over (f)}1b and {right arrow over (f)}2b are functions of the gimbal angles (ρ and γ) of the two gimbal assemblies where the thrusters are mounted. The gimbal angles are calculated from knowing the geometry and direction cosine matrices of the gimbal assemblies, the gimbal angles, and the knowledge of the center of mass 540 of satellite 100. In reverse, if a force vector is known, a closed-form solution can be used to calculate the corresponding gimbal angles. Thus, in Equation (1), the knowns are the momentum change {right arrow over (h)}b, the real unknowns are the burn durations t1 and t2, the gimbal angles ρ1 and γ1 of the first thruster, and the gimbal angles ρ2 and γ2 of the second thruster. The solution to Equation (1) has to satisfy some constraints. For example, during the attitude slew, it is desired to keep the net (linear) drift of satellite 100 to zero. The drift rate constraint equation is:

t1{right arrow over (f)}1o(1)+t2{right arrow over (f)}2o(1)=0  (2)
where {right arrow over (f)}1o(1) is the component of the first thrust force along the velocity direction in the orbit frame, and {right arrow over (f)}2o(1) is the component of the second thrust force along the velocity direction in the orbit frame. This equation is equivalent to conserving the linear momentum along the velocity direction of the orbit frame. The orbit frame vectors can be calculated from the body frame vectors if the orbit-to-body transformation matrix is known. Other constraints include: the gimbal angles have to be within an operational range of the gimbal assemblies, and the burn durations have to be less than a specified value.The solution of Equation (1), which meets the above constraints, is referred to as a feasible solution and it is obtained by an iterative process as shown below. It is also desired to have the least possible total burn duration. The minimization of the total burn time is achieved by starting the process of finding a feasible solution with a minimum initial burn time, trying several iterations of gimbal angles at the minimum initial burn time, and picking a feasible solution which has the smallest total burn time. The initial gimbal angles are selected such that the thrust vectors point through the center of mass 540, resulting in 0 Nms initial momentum change. These gimbal angles ρ0 and γ0 may be pre-calculated. Because one goal is to minimize the total burn duration, the process starts with a minimum t1,0 and t2,0. The burn durations are changed when the above constraints are violated (i.e., when the gimbal angles exceed an operational range). If the constraints are not violated, Equation (1) will eventually be satisfied with the present burn durations.Assume at the ith iteration, the following variables are known: burn duration t1,i and t2,i, the gimbal angles ρ1,i and γ1,i of the first thruster, and the gimbal angles ρ2,i and γ2,i of the second thruster. The corresponding moment arm vectors {right arrow over (r)}1,ib and {right arrow over (r)}2,ib, and and the force vectors {right arrow over (f)}1,ib and {right arrow over (f)}2,ib may then be calculated. The corresponding momentum change equation can be written as:

t1,i({right arrow over (r)}1,ib×f1,ib)+t2,i({right arrow over (r)}2,ib×{right arrow over (f)}2,ib)={right arrow over (h)}ib  (3)
The error in the momentum change Δ{right arrow over (h)}ib is defined as:

Δ{right arrow over (h)}ib={right arrow over (h)}b−{right arrow over (h)}ib  (4)

Where {right arrow over (h)}b represents the target momentum change, and {right arrow over (h)}bi represents the iteration momentum change. Slew controller 222 compares the error in the momentum change Δ{right arrow over (h)}ib to a threshold to determine if this iteration provides a feasible solution. This error in momentum change is used to adjust the force vectors as follows until the error is less than a certain threshold. The following equations may be used to determine the force vector in the next iteration:

{right arrow over (f)}1,i+1b={right arrow over (f)}1,ib+λiterxipsδ{right arrow over (f)}1,ib 

{right arrow over (f)}2,i+1b={right arrow over (f)}2,ib+λiterxipsδ{right arrow over (f)}2,ib  (5)
where δ{right arrow over (f)}1,ib and δ{right arrow over (f)}2,ib are the correction vectors that are a function of Δ{right arrow over (h)}ib. λiterxips is a gain. Assuming t1,i, t2,i, {right arrow over (r)}1,ib and {right arrow over (r)}2,ib are fixed, δ{right arrow over (f)}1,ib and δ{right arrow over (f)}2,ib are related to Δ{right arrow over (h)}ib by:

t1,i({right arrow over (r)}1,ib×δ{right arrow over (f)}1,ib)+t2,i({right arrow over (r)}2,ib×δ{right arrow over (f)}2,ib)=Δ{right arrow over (h)}ib  (6)
If the force vectors change, the moment arm vectors also change because they are a function of the same gimbal angles. However, these changes are small. Because the gimbal arms are small compared with the overall moment arm, the moment arm vectors do not change as much by moving gimbal angles. Using Equation (6) and matrix algebra, a minimum norm solution of δ{right arrow over (f)}1,ib and δ{right arrow over (f)}2,ib may be obtained as follows:Define transition matrix A as:

A=[(t1,i{right arrow over (r)}1,ib)˜(t2,i{right arrow over (r)}2,ib)˜]  (7)
where ( )˜ is a tilde operator that forms a matrix which when multiplied by a vector, gives a result that is equivalent to a cross product. The minimum norm solution is then given by:

The new force vectors {right arrow over (f)}1,i+1b and {right arrow over (f)}2,i+1b are obtained by substituting δ{right arrow over (f)}1,ib and δ{right arrow over (f)}2,ib into Equation (5). The corresponding new gimbal angles ρ1,i+1 and γ1,i+1 for the first thruster, and ρ2,i+1 and γ2,i+1 for the second thruster can then be obtained in turn. The iterative process is repeated until the error in momentum change Δ{right arrow over (h)}ib becomes less than the threshold.The burn durations may also be adjusted in the iterative process. If the gimbal angles exceed the constraint, the burn durations are increased by a small duration. The reason behind this is that by allowing more burn time, the gimbal angles will move into the acceptable region. Generally, the magnitude of the torque is smaller if the gimbal angles are in the acceptable region. Finally, the burn durations are adjusted to force the net drift of satellite 100 to zero as follows:

For the iterative process, the following inputs are used: the selected pair of thrusters, the center of mass location in the body frame, locations of two gimbal assemblies in the body frame, the orientation of the gimbal assemblies with respect to the body, thruster location in the gimbal assemblies, direction of thrust in the gimbal assemblies, the orientation of gimbal axes (ρ and γ) in the gimbal assemblies, the maximum and minimum allowed gimbal angles, the magnitude of thrust, and the desired momentum change vector in the body frame. The outputs of the iterative process are the gimbal angles (ρ and γ) for the two gimbal assemblies, and the burn durations for the two thrusters.The iterative process is summarized by the method in FIGS. 9-10. FIGS. 9-10 are flow charts illustrating a method 900 for determining parameters for an attitude slew in an exemplary embodiment. The steps of method 900 will be described with respect to satellite 100, although one skilled in the art will understand that the methods described herein may be performed for other satellites or systems not shown. Slew controller 222 determines a slew rate for the maneuver (step 902). Slew controller 222 also determines a target momentum change of satellite 100 based on the slew rate (step 904). Slew controller 222 also sets the burn duration of the first thruster and the burn duration of the second thruster at a minimum (step 906). The minimum duration may be designated as desired, such as 1 second, 2 seconds, 10 seconds, etc. Slew controller 222 sets the gimbal angles of the first thruster and the gimbal angles of the second thruster to produce thrust through the center of mass 540 of satellite 100 (step 908).Slew controller 222 then determines a momentum change of satellite 100 based on the gimbal angles and burn duration of the first thruster, and based on the gimbal angles and burn duration of the second thruster for this iteration of the process (step 910). The momentum change for an iteration of the process is referred to as an iteration momentum change. For example, slew controller 222 may use Equation (3) above to determine the iteration momentum change. Slew controller 222 is able to relate the force vector and the moment arm vector for the first thruster to the gimbal angles of the first thruster. Slew controller 222 is also able to relate the force vector and the moment arm vector for the second thruster to the gimbal angles of the second thruster. Slew controller 222 then compares the iteration momentum change to the target momentum change (step 912). Slew controller 222 determines whether the difference between the iteration momentum change and the target momentum change is less than a threshold (step 914 in FIG. 10). When the difference is less than the threshold, the iterative process has yielded a feasible solution. Thus, slew controller 222 is able to use the burn duration and gimbal angles for the first thruster, and use the burn duration and gimbal angles for the second thruster as the start or stop parameters for a maneuver (step 916). When the difference is greater than the threshold, the iterative process has not yielded a feasible solution. Thus, slew controller 222 adjusts the gimbal angles of the first thruster and the gimbal angles of the second thruster for the next iteration (step 918).Slew controller 222 also determines if the gimbal angles exceed an operational range (step 920). Each gimbal assembly has a range that it can move along the two axes, and one constraint on the iterative process is that the gimbal angles cannot exceed the operational ranges of the gimbal assemblies. If the gimbal angles of this iteration exceed the operational range, then slew controller 222 increases the burn duration of the first thruster and the burn duration of the second thruster (step 922). Method 900 then returns to step 908. If the gimbal angles of this iteration do not exceed the operational range, then method 900 returns to step 910 in FIG. 9. Slew controller 222 continues the iterative process until it yields a feasible solution.Assume for this example that the reaction wheels 204 of satellite 100 are not available due to wheel failure (see FIG. 2). Also assume that satellite 100 needs to perform an emergent 90° positive pitch slew for some safety issue. Slew controller 222 selects a pair of thrusters (e.g., northwest and southwest) that provide the most efficient way to generate a positive pitch slew. Slew controller 222 then determines the parameters for starting the maneuver. It may also be assumed that the pitch inertia for satellite 100 is about 3,641 kg-m2, and the desired slew rate is about 0.0244°/sec. Slew controller 222 may determine that the angular momentum change needed for satellite 100 to reach that slew rate would be:

(0.0244)(π/180)(3641)=1.55 Nms
However, for a real thruster, it takes time for the torque to build up to the desired momentum change level. The loss of momentum (and thus the resulting rate) is estimated to be 5%. Thus, in order to pre-compensate for that loss, 5% is added to the desired momentum change:

1.55*(1+0.05)=1.63 NMs
Slew controller 222 inputs this information into the iterative process to output the following parameters:firing the first thruster for 200 seconds with ρ=8.344° and γ=5.9364°; andfiring the second thruster for 200 seconds with ρ=6.057° and γ=8.1557°This maneuver changes the momentum of satellite 100 from 0 Nms to 1.63 Nms so the pitch rate goes from 0°/sec to 0.0244°/sec. Satellite 100 then slews toward the 90° pitch target. When satellite 100 gets close to the pitch target, satellite 100 decelerates so it stops close to the 90° pitch. To stop satellite 100, the same two thrusters are selected. Slew controller 222 inputs the momentum change from 1.63 Nms to 0 Nms into the iterative process to output the following parameters:firing the first thruster for 200 seconds with ρ=7.8682° and γ=10.4308°; andfiring the second thruster for 200 seconds with ρ=10.5915° and γ=7.5684°.Slew controller 222 has determined the acceleration time (200 sec), the deceleration time (200 sec), and the slew rate (0.0244°/sec). In order to determine the drift duration t so that the total slew angle is 90°, slew controller 222 may solve the following equation:

(½)(0.0244)(200)+(0.0244)t+(½)(0.0244)(200)=90

The solution for t in this example is 3,488 seconds. Slew controller 222 may then initiate the maneuvers using the burn durations and gimbal angles determined for the start maneuver, the burn durations and gimbal angles determined for the stop maneuver, and the drift duration of 3,488 seconds. These parameters will provide the desired 90° pitch slew on satellite 100.
FIG. 11 illustrates the timing of the start and stop maneuvers in an exemplary embodiment. Slew controller 222 initiates the start maneuver at time t1. For the start maneuver, slew controller 222 fires the first thruster for 200 seconds with ρ=8.344° and γ=5.9364°, and fires the second thruster for 200 seconds with ρ=6.057° and γ=8.1557°. This firing or acceleration time of 200 seconds achieves a slew rate of 0.0244°/sec. After the acceleration time, slew controller 222 allows satellite 100 to drift at this slew rate for 3488 seconds. After the drift duration, slew controller 222 initiates the stop maneuver at time t2. For the stop maneuver, slew controller 222 fires the first thruster for 200 seconds with ρ=7.8682° and γ=10.4308°, and fires the second thruster for 200 seconds with ρ=10.5915° and γ=7.5684°. After the stop maneuver, satellite 100 will be at the target attitude.Any of the various elements shown in the figures or described herein may be implemented as hardware, software, firmware, or some combination of these.

US09522747-20161220.XML	An apparatus for deceleration of a body may include a plurality of inflatable portions. The plurality of inflatable portions may be coupled together such that, when inflated, the plurality of inflatable portions defines a deceleration structure configured to decelerate the body. Each inflatable portion may include a first wall element, a second wall element opposite the first wall element, and a plurality of stitch members extending between and coupled to each of the first wall element and the second wall element.The present disclosure relates generally to aerodynamic decelerators (e.g., retarding mechanisms, drag inducing devices, etc.) configured to retard, or slow, the motion, or velocity, of a body (e.g., a spacecraft, water craft, a rocket, a missile, aircraft, projectile, etc.) relative to a fluid reservoir such as, e.g., an atmosphere, a body of water, etc. that the body is moving through and/or to retard, or slow, the motion, or velocity, of a fluid stream relative to a fixed body (e.g., a body fixed within the fluid stream such that the fluid stream moves by, or past, the body without the body moving).Decelerators may include one or more provisions, or structures, that may be towed, or located, behind a body (e.g., parachutes, detached ballutes, etc.) to create drag downstream of the body or may include one or more provisions, or structures, that may be attached adjacent to one or more parts, or regions, of the body, or other attached structure of the payload, (e.g., wings, isotensoid, hypercone, slats, flaps, spoilers, any aerodynamic control surface, etc.) to create drag about the body and one or more provisions.Inflatable structures may be used as decelerators. Such inflatable structures, however, may have relatively few geometric variations to define the shape and mechanical properties of the inflated, or completed, structure. Typically, if these inflatable structures are made of fabric, the elemental forms are revolved sections defining spherical or cylindrical profiles. Further, the inflatable structures may have little, or no, internal structure. For example, an inflatable structure used as a decelerator may define a form similar to a “pillow.” For example, a “pillow” form may be formed, or created, by two flat sheets of fabric adjoined along the entire perimeter and having no internal structure. The “pillow” decelerator may wrap, or form, itself around the body that it is intended to decelerate from the drag forces acting thereon. A “pillow” decelerator may not provide any control of the deceleration of the body. In other words, the “pillow” decelerator may be described as a passive deceleration apparatus.A stack of inflatable toroidal rings has been used as an aerodynamic decelerator construction for high load applications (such as the atmospheric reentry of a spacecraft). The stack of inflatable toroidal rings, when inflated, assembled, and deployed, may be configured in a cone shape.Drop stitch inflatable structures have been used as wings and stabilizers for an experimental aircraft (e.g., the GOODYEAR AEROSPACE INFLATOPLANE). Further drop stitch inflatable structures have been used, for recreational applications, such as small boat decks or floors and gymnastics equipment.The problems with decelerating bodies such as, e.g., spacecraft, with other approaches may be addressed by the exemplary inflatable deceleration apparatus described herein. For example, the exemplary deceleration apparatus may be described as being densely packed/stowed for transportation or when in the pre-deployment state, reconfigurable to adapt to multiple vehicle/body/projectile installations (e.g., multiple configurations may be used for various different practical deployment applications), easily filled with inflation media (e.g., no part of the system may be burdened by the inflation apparatus), adaptive to multiple fluid reservoir environments (such as, e.g., Venus, which has comparatively thick planetary atmosphere, or Mars, which has a comparatively thin planetary atmosphere), tailorable to suit individual case, low mass, reliable, scalable, modular, etc. and/or may have few integration requirements.One exemplary apparatus for decelerating a body may include a plurality of inflatable portions coupled to the body. Each inflatable portion of the plurality of inflatable portions may include a first wall element, a second wall element coupled to the first wall element to define a cavity, and a plurality of stich members (e.g., defining a double-walled, drop-stitch structure).

The restraint apparatus, when in the storage configuration, may restrict at least one region of at least one inflatable portion of the plurality of inflatable portions from filling with the fluid when the at least one inflatable portion is configured in the deployed configuration, and the restraint apparatus, when in the released configuration, may release the at least one region of the at least one inflatable portion of the plurality of inflatable portions for filling with the fluid.One exemplary apparatus for decelerating a body may include a plurality of inflatable portions coupled to the body. Each inflatable portion of the plurality of inflatable portions may include a first wall element, a second wall element coupled to the first wall element to define a cavity, and a plurality of stich members. Each stitch member of the plurality of stitch members may extend between and may be coupled to each of the first wall element and the second wall element to restrict movement between the first wall element and the second wall element when the cavity is filled with a fluid. Each of the inflatable portion of the plurality of inflatable portions may be coupled together to form a deceleration when the plurality of inflatable portions are inflated with fluid so as to be expanded and resilient. The deceleration may provide a deceleration surface area greater than a pre-deployment surface area defined by the body with prior to inflation of the plurality of inflatable portions.

Additional structures may be intended to provide secondary load bearing capacity during deflection or unpredicted loads and can be readily applied to the one or more embodiments described herein. Such structures may include buttresses, shear webs, flexible stays, air beams, air bags (e.g., pillows primarily used to fill voids where the surrounding structure will bear and provide support), etc.An exemplary deployable deceleration apparatus may be attached or towed behind a body so that a greater control of the final form, as well as increased structural efficiency, is possible by utilization of drop stitch technical textiles.

This may include tape of a material compatible for adhesion to adjoin the gore panels, permanent clips such as staples or rivets, etc.One exemplary deceleration apparatus to be deployed into or against a fluid stream moving relative to the apparatus (e.g., to retard motion during free flight in the fluid stream or fluid medium) may include one or more inflatable segments or portions.

It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from (e.g., still falling within) the scope of the disclosure presented hereby.Exemplary embodiments shall be described with reference to FIGS. 1-9. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that elements (e.g., apparatus, structures, parts, portions, regions, configurations, functionalities, method steps, materials, etc.) from one embodiment may be used in combination with elements of the other embodiments, and that the possible embodiments of such apparatus and systems using combinations of features set forth herein is not limited to the specific embodiments shown in the figures and/or described herein. Further, it will be recognized that the embodiments described herein may include many elements that are not necessarily shown to scale. Still further, it will be recognized that the size and shape of various elements herein may be modified but still fall within the scope of the present disclosure, although certain one or more shapes and/or sizes, or types of elements, may be advantageous over others.Exemplary apparatus for decelerating a body are described herein. Generally, the exemplary deceleration apparatus may include one or more inflatable portions that may be used to provide a deceleration structure for, e.g., atmospheric entry systems. The inflatable portions may be configured in a stowed configuration, e.g., during transit, and a deployed configuration, e.g., during deceleration when entering an atmosphere of a planet. When in the deployed configuration, the one or more inflatable portions may define, or form, a deceleration structure about, or proximate, the body to decelerate the body within a fluid environment. Although the exemplary deceleration apparatus described herein may be primarily described within respect to spacecraft, and more specifically, spacecraft being decelerated from high speeds whilst entering an atmosphere of a planetary body, the exemplary deceleration apparatus may be used with respect to any problem or endeavor in conjunction with decelerating any body or object.Generally, the exemplary deceleration apparatus, or apparatus for decelerating an object, may be stowed, or in a stowed configuration, until the object, or body, that the apparatus is attached, or coupled, thereof is ready to be decelerated and then the exemplary deceleration apparatus may be released and deployed to provide deceleration of the body, or object, by, e.g., increasing the surface area of the object or body.The exemplary apparatus may be described in terms of various configurations or states. For example, when the deceleration apparatus, or one or more portions thereof, are stowed, and thus, may not be configured to decelerate the body, it may be described herein the deceleration apparatus, or one or more portions thereof, is in, or configured in, a stowed configuration. Further, when the deceleration apparatus, or one or more portions thereof, are deployed and thus configured to decelerate the body, it may be described herein that the deceleration apparatus, or one or more portions thereof, are in, or configured in, a deployed configuration. The exemplary deceleration apparatus may decelerate a body by increasing the surface area of a body, and to do so, the deceleration apparatus may change shape and size when transitioning from the stowed configuration to the deployed configuration.Multiple views of exemplary deceleration apparatus 10 are depicted in FIGS. 1A-1D. As shown in FIG. 1A, the exemplary apparatus 10 is configured in a stowed configuration and is coupled to, or attached to, a body 11. As shown, the body 11 may be a spacecraft such as, e.g., capsule, satellite, sample return vehicle (e.g., vehicle for returning soil samples from Mars, an asteroid, etc.), an extravehicular emergency astronaut deorbit vehicle, etc. In other embodiments, the body may not be spacecraft, and may instead be a watercraft, torpedo, aircraft, missile, rocket, rocket launch vehicle segment, free-fall ordinance (e.g., bomb), etc. Although the deceleration apparatus 10 is described as being coupled, or attached to, the body 11, the deceleration apparatus 10 may also be described as being integral, or part of the body 11. As shown, the deceleration apparatus 10 is located proximate, or near, a front end portion 20 of the body 11. In other embodiments, the deceleration apparatus 10 may be located proximate, or near, a rear end portion 22 of the body 11 or somewhere between the rear end portion 22 and the front end portion 20, depending on the desired purpose. In the example depicted, the deceleration apparatus 10 may be located proximate the front end portion 20 of the body 11 to, e.g., provide a heat shield for the body 11 when decelerating through an atmosphere, provide aerodynamic stability when decelerating through an atmosphere, and/or provide locations and operation of control surfaces such as trim tabs, flaps, spoilers, etc.The body 11 may be described as lying along a central axis 12, which may also be the direction of travel, or trajectory, 14 of the body 11. For example, the body 11 may be described as moving along central axis 12 in direction 14. It is to be understood, however, that when the body 11 is decelerating, e.g., within an atmosphere of a planet, the direction of travel, or trajectory, 14 may not lie along the central axis 12 due to, e.g., aerodynamic forces such as lift, drag, etc. In other words, an induced angle of attack may provide roll or pitch that the trajectory path and the axis of the body's coordinate system are not coaxial. Nonetheless, many of the features and elements of the exemplary apparatus described herein may be described with respect to the central axis 12 of the body 11 and the direction 14 of travel as shown in the Figures.Further, as shown, the deceleration apparatus 10 may be covered, or located within, one or more protection elements 16, such as, e.g., a heat shield, a nose cone, etc. In at least one embodiment, it may be described that the deceleration apparatus 10 may be protected in thermally severe environments (e.g., atmospheric entry) by a thermal protection system (e.g., which may be pleated or folded).The protection elements 16 may assist in maintaining the deceleration apparatus 10 in the stowed configuration. The stowed configuration may be generally defined as a configuration in which the deceleration apparatus 10 is not being actively used to decelerate the body 11. For example, the deceleration apparatus 10 may be in a stowed configuration when the body is traveling between planets (e.g., when deceleration of the body is not desired). Further, the deceleration apparatus 10 may be described as defining less volume, or taking up less space, when configured in the stowed configuration.The deceleration apparatus 10 is configured in the deployed configuration in FIGS. 1B-1D. The deceleration apparatus 10 may include a plurality of inflatable portions 30, and as shown in FIGS. 1B-1D, the plurality of inflatable portions 30 are configured in the deployed configured to, e.g., form, or provide, a deceleration, or drag, surface area greater than a surface area defined by the body with each of the plurality of inflatable portions 30 configured in the stowed configuration. In other words, the plurality of inflatable portions 30 may define, or form, a deceleration, or drag, structure 33 configured to decelerate the body 11. As shown, the deceleration structure 33 resembles a blunted cone-type shape. In other embodiments, the deceleration structure 33 may be formed, or defined, by a plurality of inflatable portions 30 configured in the deployed configuration may resemble a wedge-type shape, wing/airfoil-type shape, capsule-type shape, etc.The deceleration structure 33 may be covered, or coated, by one or more portions, materials, or coatings to provide a forward surface of the deceleration structure 33. The forward surface of the deceleration structure 33 may face the direction of travel 14. The forward surface may include one or more heat resistant or insulative materials to, e.g., shield or insulate the body 11 from heat that may be created due to the deceleration.As described herein, that plurality of inflatable portions 30 may form, or provide, a deceleration, or drag, surface area when in the deployed configuration greater than a surface area defined by the body 11 with each of the plurality of inflatable portions 30 configured in the stowed configuration. For example, as shown in the side views of FIGS. 1A-1B, one dimension of the surface area defined by the body 11 with each of the plurality of inflatable portions 30 configured in the stowed configuration may be represented by line 36, and one dimension of the deceleration, or drag, surface area defined by each of the plurality of inflatable portions 30 configured in the deployed configuration may be represented by line 38. Line 38 is longer than line 36, which indicates that the deceleration, or drag, surface area is greater than the pre-deployment surface area. Additionally, although one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that lines 36, 38 only represent one dimension of at least a two-dimensional surface area comparison, it would be understood by one having ordinary skill in the art that the deceleration surface area defined by the plurality of inflatable portions 30 as shown in FIGS. 1B-1D is greater than the pre-deployment surface area defined by the body 11 with each of the plurality of inflatable portions 30 configured in the stowed configuration.The diameter of the deceleration surface area (e.g., the diameter taken perpendicular to the axis 12 such as in the FIG. 1D) defined by exemplary deceleration apparatus 10 when deployed may be about 1 meter to about 30 meters. For example, the diameter of the deceleration surface area defined by exemplary deceleration apparatus 10 when deployed may be greater than or equal to about 1 meter, greater than or equal to about 2 meters, greater than or equal to about 3 meters, greater than or equal to about 5 meters, greater than or equal to about 10 meters, greater than or equal to about 15 meters, greater than or equal to about 20 meters, etc. and/or less than or equal to about 50 meters, less than or equal to about 40 meters, less than or equal to about 35 meters, less than or equal to about 30 meters, less than or equal to about 25 meters, less than or equal to about 20 meters, less than or equal to about 15 meters, less than or equal to about 10 meters, etc.In at least one embodiment, it may be described that prior to performing the primary function of inducing drag forces between a body and a relatively moving fluid, the initial physical state of the deceleration apparatus 10 is a folded or otherwise reduced-volume configuration where the inflatable portions can be enclosed within a geometric constraint volume. Further, one exemplary deceleration apparatus 10 may be configured in a packed form for use in rocket launched vehicles. Further, the deceleration apparatus 10 may be deployed using a fluid media being of either incompressible type (such as, e.g., water or similar), or compressible (such as, e.g., gaseous nitrogen or carbon dioxide).The body 11 or deceleration apparatus 10 may further include a tip portion 15. If the tip portion 15 is part of the deceleration apparatus 10, the tip portion 15 may also be an inflatable portion similar to the inflatable portions 30 described herein. If the tip portion 15 is part of the body 11, the tip portion 15 may be a protective shield portion configured to protect the front end portion 20 of the body 11.The plurality of inflatable portions 30 may be attached, or coupled, to each other at one or more seam regions 32 as shown in FIGS. 1C-1D. The inflatable portions 30 may be coupled to each other about the seam regions 32 by using stitching, adhesive, adhesive sealant, staples, bolts, clips, rivets, permanent clips, zippers, bolt ropes, grommets, clamps, etc. The coupling between the plurality inflatable portions 30 may define, or assist in the definition of, the shape of the deceleration structure 33. For example, when each of the inflatable portions 30 are being inflated and begin to take shape, the coupling between the inflatable portions 30 may restrict the movement of other inflatable portions such that the deceleration, or drag, structure 33 is formed or shaped.Additionally, it may be described that the elements and/or structure of each of the inflatable portions 30 may provide the structural stability and shape of the deceleration structure 33 when the inflatable portions 30 are configured in the deployed configuration. As described herein the plurality of inflatable portions 30 may be deflated, or void of a fluid, when in the stowed configuration, and may be inflated, or full of a fluid, when in the deployed configuration.An exemplary inflatable portion 30 is depicted in FIG. 2. As shown, the inflatable portion includes a first wall element 40 and a second wall element 42 located opposite the first wall element 40. The first wall element 40 and the second wall element 42 define a cavity 45 therebetween or therein. Generally, the cavity of the inflatable portion 30 is sealed such that air or another fluid may be sealed within the cavity so as to provide inflation and/or deflation of the cavity 45 of the inflatable portion. As shown, side wall elements are not shown coupling between the first and second wall elements 40, 42 as to show the internal structure of the exemplary inflatable portion 30.The wall elements 40, 42 may include one or more materials such as, e.g., carbon fiber, aromatic polyamide (e.g., aramid), aliphatic polyamide (e.g., nylon), aromatic polyimide (e.g., KAPTON), polyoxazole (e.g., ZYLON), polypropylene, polyester, and/or any combinations thereof. Additionally, the wall elements 40, 42 may be produced, or formed, at the same time (e.g., simultaneously on the same loom) as further described herein. Further, one or more materials may be applied to the wall elements 40, 42 to provide structural support, a fluid/air-tight seal, a resilient structure, bonding surfaces for attachment, protection from the environment (e.g., ultraviolet light, solar heating, etc.), protection of the double wall element from impact and abrasion, etc. For example, materials that may be applied to the wall elements 40, 42 may include silicone, urethane, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyimide, polyvinyl chloride, polychloroprene, and/or any combinations thereof.The exemplary inflatable portion 30 may further include a plurality of stich members 44 extending between the first wall element 40 and the second wall element 42. The stitch members 44 may be configured, generally, to restrict movement between the first wall element 40 and the second wall element 42 when the cavity 45 is filled with a fluid. For example, a distance 50 may be defined between the first wall element 40 and the second wall element 42, and it may be described that the stitch members 44 restrict the distance from increasing beyond a selected value based on multiple factors such as but not limited to the length of the stitch members 30, flexibility of the stitch members 30, density of the stitch members 30 (e.g., stitch members 40 per area). When the inflatable portion 30 is in the stowed configuration and the cavity 45 is void of fluid therein, the stitch members 44 may allow the first and second wall elements 40, 42 to lie proximate one another for storage in a compact space.Further, it may be described that, when the cavity 45 of the inflatable portion 30 is filled with a fluid, the inflatable portion 30 is expanded and resilient. The plurality of stitch members 44 may provide the resiliency (e.g., rigidity, stiffness, resistance to deflection, etc.) to the inflatable portion 30, e.g., by providing structural strength to the inflatable portion 30. Further, the plurality of stitch members 44 may be distribute any forces applied to the inflatable portion 30 across the entire, or a majority of, the inflatable portion 30. In other words, each stitch member 44 of the plurality of stitch members 44 may carry a portion of any force or load applied to the inflatable portion 30.The stich members 44 may be further configured to provide one or more shapes out of the inflatable portions 30. For example, the stitch members 44 may provide substantially planar, panel structures formed by the inflatable portions 30. Further, for example, the stitch members 44 may provide substantially planar, box-shaped structures formed by the inflatable portions 30. In other words, the wall elements 40, 42 may be substantially parallel each to form a box-like shape. In at least one embodiment, the wall elements 40, 42 are substantially parallel each other for the entire inflatable portion 30. In other embodiments, the wall elements 40, 42 may only be substantially parallel each other about one or more sections of the inflatable portion 30.Still further, for example, stitch members 44 in a first region of an inflatable portion 30 may be longer (e.g., the length of the stitch member 44 may be defined between the first wall element 40 and the second wall element 42) than stitch members 44 in a second region of the inflatable portion 30. Thus, the distance 50 in the first region may be greater than the distance 50 in the second region. In other words, the inflatable portion 30 may be thicker in the first region than in the second region. As a result, the lengths of the stitch members 44 may be configured, or selected, to provide a plurality of different shapes out of the inflatable portions 30. Further, the flexibility and/or density of the stitch members 44 may also be adjusted to provide a plurality of different shapes out of the inflatable portions 30. For example, the stitch density of the stitch members 44 in a first region (e.g., the number, or amount, of stitch members 44 in a region) of an inflatable portion 30 may be greater than the stitch density of the stitch members 44 in a second region of the inflatable portion 30. When the inflatable portion 30 is fully inflated, the second region may define a distance 50 greater than the first region because the first region has a higher stitch density than the second region (e.g., more structure may be provided by the stitch members 44 within the first region restricting the first wall element 40 from the second wall element 42 than in the second region). Further, for example, the flexibility of the stitch members 44 in a first region of an inflatable portion 30 may be greater than the flexibility of the stitch members 44 in a second region of the inflatable portion 30, and thus, the first region may define a greater distance 50 than the second region. In other words, one or more properties of the stitch members 44 may be selected, or configured, to provide a plurality of different shapes using the first and second wall elements 40, 42.The length of the stitch members 44 may be about 0.5 inches to about 20 inches. For example, the length of the stitch members 44 may be greater than or equal to about 0.5 inches, greater than or equal to about 1 inch, greater than or equal to about 2 inches, greater than or equal to about 3 inches, greater than or equal to about 4 inches, greater than or equal to about 5 inches, greater than or equal to about 7 inches, greater than or equal to about 10 inches, etc. and/or less than or equal to about 20 inches, less than or equal to about 17 inches, less than or equal to about 15 inches, less than or equal to about 12 inches, less than or equal to about 11 inches, less than or equal to about 10 inches, less than or equal to about 8 inches, less than or equal to about 6 inches, less than or equal to about 5 inches, less than or equal to about 3 inches, etc.The stitch members 44 may include one or more materials such as, e.g., carbon fiber, aromatic polyamide (e.g., aramid), aliphatic polyamide (e.g., nylon), aromatic polyimide (e.g., KAPTON), polyoxazole (e.g., ZYLON), polypropylene, polyester, and/or any combinations thereof. Additionally, the stitch members 44 may be produced, or formed, at the same time (e.g., simultaneously on the same loom) as the wall elements 40, 42 as further described herein. In at least one embodiment, the stitch members 44 may be described as being cylindrical threads. In at least another embodiment, the stitch members 44 may be described as being woven threads. It may be described the stitch members 44 do not divide compartments within the cavities 45 of the inflatable portions because, e.g., fluid may flow freely therethrough the stitch members 44 (e.g., as opposed to internal webbing or baffle structures location within a cavity of an inflatable portion). In other words, the stitch members 44 may be described as not restricting fluid flow within the cavity 45 of an inflatable portion 30 (e.g., as opposed to internal webbing or baffle structures location within a cavity of an inflatable portion that may be designed to restrict fluid flow within a cavity). Additionally, the stitch members 44 may not be described as forming a wall, a web, or the like—instead, each of the stitch members 44 may be described as an individual, or singular, member, or structure, extending between the first wall element 40 and the second wall element 42.Although the wall elements 40, 42 and stitch members 44 may be formed using one or more techniques or processes and are not to be limited by any techniques or processes described herein, the wall elements 40, 42 and stitch members 44 may be formed using a “drop stitch” technique. Exemplary “drop stich” processes and structures may be described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,698,020 entitled “Inflatable Fabric Structural Element” and issued on Dec. 28, 1954, U.S. Pat. No. 3,327,738 entitled “Double Face Connected Carpet Structure” and issued on Jun. 27, 1987, U.S. Pat. No. 3,519,032 entitled “Pile Fabrics” issued on Jul. 7, 1970, U.S. Pat. No. 4,756,340 entitled “Jacquared Double Plush Fabric” and issued on Jul. 12, 1988, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,448 entitled “Flexible Ceramic Thermal Protection System Resistant To High Aeroacoustic Noise Comprising A Three-Dimensional Woven-Fiber Structure Having A Multilayer Top Fabric Layer, A Bottom Fabric Layer And An Intermediate Rib Fabric Layer” and issued on Sep. 19, 1995, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.In at least one embodiment, it may be described that the inflatable portions 30 may be formed by a drop-stitch technical textile, which includes constituent layers of coating and a primary structure of fabric. Further, the drop-stitch textile may be woven on a specialized loom that fabricates a face-to-face double walled fabric having a plurality of tie threads consistent with the engineering and manufacturing requirements set forth by a design authority. Warp and Weft materials can be any material consistent with a weaving process. Coatings can be any material consistent with fabric coating of woven materials. Further, the drop stitch technical textile may be enclosed into an engineered inflatable structure by sealing the edges of the drop stitch technical textile with a flat seam, locally attaching the first wall, or panel, element and the second wall, or panel, element, or installing an additional material in the form of a tape for a smooth transitional surface. Such tape may typically, but not necessarily, be formed of a similar base material as the base fabric of the drop stitch technical textile, which may create a fluid-tight gore that can be filled and drained through a passage or valve (e.g., a non-return valve for protection against leaks in the overall system).Another exemplary inflatable portion 30 is depicted in FIG. 3. As shown, the inflatable portion 30 includes a first wall element 40, a second wall element 42, and a plurality of stitch members 44 extending therebetween and defining a cavity 45 similar to the inflatable portion 30 of FIG. 2. Additionally, the inflatable portion 30 of FIG. 3 includes a valve 52 configured to be coupled to an inflation apparatus 60.The inflation apparatus 60 may be any apparatus capable of providing, or delivering, fluid to the cavities 45 of the inflatable portions 30 of the deceleration apparatus 10. The inflation apparatus 60 may include a pressure vessel, or chamber, for holding pressurized material, such as, e.g., carbon dioxide (gas or liquid), nitrogen, helium, argon, air, expanding foam, etc. The inflation apparatus 60 may be actuated to inflate the inflatable portions 30 by delivering a fluid resulting from release of a pressurized material to inflate the inflatable portions 30 thereby placing, or configuring, the inflatable portions 30 in a deployed configuration. The inflation apparatus 60 may include, e.g., a valve that, when opened, releases gas from the pressure vessel through a conduit 62 and through the valve 52 into the cavity 45 of the inflatable portion 30.The inflation apparatus 60 may further include gas generators that use energetic materials that deflagrate to produce a slag byproduct and a working gaseous medium. For example, the gas generators may include grain material and binder material such as combinations of sodium azide, and/or glycidyl azide polymer. Thermal management and slag production may be controlled by application of cooling salts such as those having lithium. Further, filtration and desiccant materials may refine the output when needed for high purity applications. The storage vessel containing this assembly of materials may not be initially pressurized, such as the open nozzle of a solid rocket engine (e.g., one example of a gas generator). Still further, for an inflation generator, the vessel may be designed for rapid changes in pressure and temperature as well as gradients of the same. Some exemplary inflation devices may be a hybrid of a pressurized storage vessel and a gas generator solid-grain type inflator, which may be efficient in terms of mass output versus mass of pre-operation storage.The valve 52 may be a one-way valve such that, e.g., the valve 52 allows fluid to flow into the cavity 45 of the inflatable portion 30 and restricts fluid from leaving the cavity 45 of the inflatable portion 30. In another embodiment, the valve 52 may allow fluid to leave the cavity 45 of an inflatable portion 30 to enter another inflatable portion 30 to, e.g., maintain equal pressure through all of a plurality of inflatable portions 30 if an inflatable portion is leaking or otherwise deviating from a predefined filling schedule.In one or more embodiments, it may be described that the deceleration apparatus 10 may include a centralized fill system that may be configured transfer inflation media into the inflatable portions 30 or an intermediate accumulator as may be used for mass transfer. To aid inflation time and minimize backpressure, the fill ports, or valve structures, for the inflatable portions 30 may be located directly on a body of a payload assembly. In another embodiment, it may be described that the deceleration apparatus 10 may include a decentralized fill system having storage apparatus for inflation as an integral part of each inflatable portion 30 (e.g., gore panel assembly, as a part of the inflatable portion 30, enclosed within the cavity of an inflatable portion 30, etc.) and can provide inflation mass flow rates consistent with inflation while moving in fluid fields of greater densities (e.g., requiring shape and structure be achieved in the shortest period of time possible without impacting the physical integrity or performance of the textile).Further, the inflation apparatus 60 may be include a scoop aperture configured to capture fluid during deceleration for use in filling the plurality of inflatable portions 30 with fluid to configure the plurality of inflatable portions 30 into the deployed configuration. In other words, the inflation apparatus 60 may collect fluid passively during deceleration using the scoop aperture, which may be advantageous such that fluid need not be stored prior to inflation. For example, it may be described that the inflation apparatus 60 includes a set of scoops, which can be flexible or fully rigid, which will transfer inflation media into the inflatable portions 30 by collecting a positive pressure encountered by the movement of the body 11 through a fluid medium (e.g., which may be used on an Isotensoid).The inflatable portion 30 shown in FIG. 3 further includes a pair of side wall elements 49 that extend between the first wall element 40 and second wall element 42. The side wall elements 49 may allow the inflatable portion 30 to retain a “box”-like shape when inflated in the deployed configuration (e.g., a “box”-like shape may define semi-squared corners where the side wall elements 49 meet, or intersect, the first and second wall elements 40, 42). In at least another embodiment, the inflatable portion 30 may not include side wall elements 49—instead the edges of the first wall element 40 and the second wall element 42 may be coupled, or edge-sealed, together (e.g., using an adhesives, stitching, mechanical fasteners, etc.).Exemplary deceleration apparatus described herein may include one or more inflatable support portions. For example, one or more of the plurality of inflatable portions 30 may be used for structural support of the deceleration structure 33 when the plurality of inflatable portions 30 are configured in the deployed configuration.The exemplary deceleration apparatus 70 depicted in FIGS. 4A-4D includes a plurality of inflatable support portions 72. The inflatable support portions 72 may include the same structures and elements as the inflatable portions 30 described herein. For example, the inflatable support portions 72 may include a first wall element, a second wall element, and a plurality of stitch members extending between the first wall element and the second wall element (e.g., a double wall, drop stitch structure).The inflatable support portions 72, as shown, are coupled to two different inflatable portions 30 along the seam region 32 between the two different inflatable portions 30 and the body 11. The inflatable support portions 72 are triangularly-shaped to provide support to the inflatable portions 30. More specifically, the inflatable support portions 72 may support the inflatable portions 30 from forces applied opposite the direction 14 of travel. Additionally, the inflatable support portions 72 may further assist the plurality of inflatable portions 30 from moving into and forming the deceleration structure 30 when transitioning from the stowed configuration to the deployed configuration. For example, the inflatable support portions 72 may be inflated at the same time that the inflatable portions 30 are inflated, and may be configured to push, or position, the other inflatable portions 30 into proper location to form the deceleration structure. Further, the inflatable support portions 72 may be coupled to one or more of the body 11 and the inflatable portions 30 using the same apparatus and techniques as described herein with respect to the coupling of the inflatable portions 30 to one another.A cross-sectional view of a portion of the deceleration apparatus of FIG. 4A taken across line A-A of FIG. 4C is shown in FIG. 4D that shows the construction and configuration of an inflatable portion 30 and an inflatable support portion 72 with respect to the body 11. As shown, the inflatable portion 30 includes a first wall element 40, a second wall element 42, a plurality of stitch members 44 extending between the first wall element 40 and the second wall element 42, and a pair of sidewall elements 49 extending between the first wall element 40 and the second wall element 42 defining a cavity 45. Further, the triangularly-shaped inflatable support portion 72 is shown coupled to and adjacent the inflatable portion 30 and coupled to and adjacent the body 11. Further shown in FIG. 4D is a seam region 32 between two different inflatable portions 30 that is denoted between a pair of dotted lines.Exemplary deceleration apparatus may further be configured to control, or affect, the trajectory of a body when decelerating, e.g., through an atmosphere of a planet. To provide such control or effect, the exemplary deceleration apparatus may include one or more regions or structures and/or functionality to change the deceleration structure to affect the aerodynamics of the deceleration structure.For example, the deceleration apparatus may include one or more regions that may affect the symmetry of the deceleration structure about the axis 12 such as, e.g., tab regions, slats, control surfaces, spoilers, flaps, trim regions, spars, etc. Further, for example, the deceleration apparatus may be configured such that one or more inflatable portions are not inflated or partially inflated (e.g., not placed in a deployed or fully-deployed configuration) while one or more inflatable portions are fully inflated (e.g., placed in a fully-deployed configuration) to affect the symmetry of the deceleration structure about the axis 12. When the symmetry of the deceleration structure about the axis 12 is altered, one region of the deceleration structure may provide more lift than at least another region of the deceleration structure, which may, among other things, assist in stabilizing the body 11 and deceleration apparatus during deceleration.Exemplary deceleration apparatus 80 that includes an element configured to affect the symmetry of the deceleration structure about the axis 12 is depicted in FIGS. 5A-5D. More particularly, one of the inflatable portions 30 includes, or defines, a region, or portion, 82 that may be restricted, or restrained, from deploying when the inflatable portion 30 is configured in the deployed configuration. For example, as shown in FIGS. 5A-5B, restraint apparatus 84 is configured to restrict region 82 of the inflatable portion 30 from filling with a fluid to deploy (even though the remainder of the inflatable portion 30 has been inflated and deployed). As shown, the restraint apparatus 84 includes attachment features that are affixed to the surface of the panel wall exterior face or surface, which may serve as the anchor points for the mechanism (e.g., which is flexible and resilient enough to be stowed in the system storage assembly). Using those attachment points, a quick release linear knot such as a braid of interlocking loops may allow for single point activation of the deployment, which may accomplished by cutting or releasing the terminal knot, and upon severing this tie, the entirety of the knot may be released in line due to the lack tension required to maintain the shape of the loops.The restraint apparatus 84 may release the region 82 to allow the region 82 to fill with fluid and deploy as shown in FIGS. 5C-5D. When the region 82 has deployed, the deceleration apparatus 80 may define an asymmetric deceleration structure about the axis 12. As described herein, when a deceleration structure is described as being asymmetric, it is to be understood that that the drag profile when viewed along the axis 12 is not uniform about the deceleration structure, and instead, one or more regions may generate more lift than one or more other regions of the deceleration structure. Further, one or more regions may define a larger deceleration surface area while one or more regions may define a smaller deceleration surface area. For example, as shown in FIG. 5D, if the deceleration apparatus 80 is divided along a line 90 extending through the axis 12 and perpendicular thereto, the left region 92 (i.e., the region of the deceleration apparatus 80 located to the left of line 90) defines a smaller deceleration surface area than the right region 94 (i.e., the region of the deceleration apparatus 80 located to the right of line 90). As such, when the restraint apparatus 84 releases the region 82, the deceleration apparatus 80 may transition from a symmetric deceleration structure to an asymmetric deceleration structure.Further, exemplary deceleration apparatus may be configured to always be asymmetric when in the deployed configuration. For example, exemplary deceleration apparatus 100 as shown in FIGS. 6A-6B defines an asymmetric deceleration structure when configured in the deployed configuration.More specifically, the deceleration apparatus 100 includes three inflatable portions 102 located to one side of the deceleration structure that are larger than the other five inflatable portions 104. The imbalance, or non-uniformity, in the size and placement of the inflatable portions 102, 104 may create an asymmetric deceleration structure, which may be beneficial as described herein. Similar to deceleration apparatus 80, deceleration apparatus 100 may be divided along a line 90 extending through the axis 12 and perpendicular thereto, the left region 92 (i.e., the region of the deceleration apparatus 80 located to the left of line 90) defines a smaller deceleration surface area than the right region 94 (i.e., the region of the deceleration apparatus 100 located to the right of line 90) as shown in FIG. 6B.Exemplary deceleration apparatus may further include more than one deployment configuration or stage such that, e.g., the deceleration apparatus may assist the deceleration of a body through one or more time periods of deceleration, allow for reduce mass utilization when a thermal protection system (TPS) is employed (e.g., the second stage may not see any appreciable aerothermal heating, and thus, may not require mass-intensive TPS), allow for re-introduction of a symmetric profile (such, e.g., as the first stage being asymmetrical and the second stage being symmetrical about the central axis of the rigid body), etc. An exemplary two-deployment configuration, or stage, deceleration apparatus 110 is depicted in FIGS. 7A-7B.More particularly, on the left side of each of FIGS. 7A-7B, the deceleration apparatus 110 is configured in a first deployed configuration, which may be similar to the previously-described deployed configurations where the deceleration structure formed, or defined, by the deceleration apparatus 110 has a greater deceleration surface area than the body 11 and the deceleration apparatus 110 prior to deployment. In this embodiment, however, regions 120 of the inflatable portions 30 may be retrained, e.g., using retraining apparatus similar to the restraining apparatus 84 described herein with reference to FIGS. 5A-5D, during the first deployed configuration 112. For example, the regions 120 may be folded, or rolled, over themselves and restrained on the back side of the deceleration structure.The deceleration apparatus 110 may transition 115 from the first deployed configuration 112 to the second deployed configuration 114 by releasing the regions 120 of the inflatable portions 30. After the regions 120 of the inflatable portions are released, the regions 120 may fill with fluid and become deployed as shown on the right side of FIGS. 6A-6B. Additionally, the second deployed configuration 114 may defined a deceleration surface area that is greater than the deceleration surface area of the first deployed configuration.As shown in this embodiment, the regions 120 when deployed may include rib portions 122 extending radially from the remainder of the inflatable portions and end portions 124 located on a distal end of the rib portions 122. Additionally, although an aperture or opening appears to extend between the rib portions 122, material such as, e.g., heat shield material, etc. may cover the front side (e.g., the side facing the direction 14 of travel) of the deceleration structure such that no aperture or opening extends through the deceleration structure.In at least one embodiment, it may be described that a secondary stage (or stages further to second stage) may be employed. The secondary stage of the declaration apparatus may be of a monolithic form (e.g., where part of the first stage is retained to allow for immediate deployment of a pre-pressurized body of fill media) or can be a composite form having a wholly unique and independent structure, and may either employ expansion of the initial fill media system.The inflatable portions 30 may be coupled to one another, the body 11, and/or any other portion or structure using various structures and techniques. Three different coupling techniques are depicted in FIG. 8. For example, an exemplary inflatable portion 30 may be coupled to another element through the use of a bolt-rope coupling configuration 150. More specifically, a rope, or similar material, may be located within a folded over and coupled portion of the material, and a rigid C-channel portion may be slid over the rope located within the folded over portion of material to provide an interference fit therebetween. The bolt-rope coupling configuration may be beneficial to distribute any forces impacted on the inflatable portion 30 across the entire coupling.Further, for example, a “drawbar” coupling configuration 152 is also depicted. A rigid shaft, or draw bar, is located within a fold of the material of the inflatable portion 30. In this configuration, however, openings 154 may expose one or more portions of the rigid shaft, which may be coupled thereto. Still further, for example, a “strap” coupling configuration 156 is further depicted in which straps are fixedly coupled to the inflatable portion and the straps may be releasably coupled to other portions such as the body 11.Exemplary deceleration apparatus described herein may include one or more inflatable portions 30 that overlap one another to, e.g., provide more support, etc. A cross-sectional view of three inflatable portions 30 with one inflatable portion 30 overlapping, or laminating, a seam region 32 between the other two inflatable portions 30 is depicted in FIG. 9. Such seam overlapping, or laminated, configuration may provide support to the seam regions 32 and provide additional redundancy to the exemplary deceleration apparatus. Although only a single seam region 32 is depicted being laminated, or overlapped, by an inflatable portions in FIG. 9, a plurality of seam regions 32 (e.g., two or more seam regions 32, all the seam regions 32, all the seam regions 32 facing a particular direction, etc.) of the exemplary deceleration apparatus described herein may be laminated, or overlapped, by another inflatable portion 30.All patents, patent documents, and references cited herein are incorporated in their entirety as if each were incorporated separately. This disclosure has been provided with reference to illustrative embodiments and is not meant to be construed in a limiting sense. As described previously, one skilled in the art will recognize that other various illustrative applications may use the techniques as described herein to take advantage of the beneficial characteristics of the system and methods described herein. Various modifications of the illustrative embodiments, as well as additional embodiments of the disclosure, will be apparent upon reference to this description.1. An apparatus for decelerating a body along a direction of travel, the body comprising a front end portion directed toward the direction of travel and a rear end portion opposite the front end portion, the apparatus comprising:

US09522748-20161220.XML	An apparatus for blowing and filling a plastic container from a preform and using liquid as the blowing medium. The apparatus includes a mold encloses a preform so as to leave access to the mouth of the preform protruding from the upper surface of the mold. An injection head is provided for injecting a liquid into the preform and a liquid collecting member is provided for collecting any residual liquid present between the injection head and the neck of the blown and liquid filled container before opening the mold and/or moving the injection head away from the mold.This application is based upon, and claims the benefit of priority from, corresponding European Patent Application No. 12151392.3 filed Jan. 17, 2012, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.The invention relates to an apparatus for blowing and filling containers from preforms.Plastic containers such as bottles of water are manufactured and filled according to different methods including blow molding or stretch-blow molding.According to one of these known methods a plastic preform is first manufactured through a molding process and then heated before being positioned inside a blowing mold.The preform usually takes the form of a cylindrical tube closed at its bottom end and open at its opposite end.Once the preform has been positioned within the mold only the open end of the preform is visible from above the mold.A liquid injection head comprising an injection valve is brought into a sealing engagement with the upper surface of the mold around the open end of the preform.The above-mentioned method makes use of a stretch rod which is downwardly engaged into the open end of the preform so as to abut against the closed bottom end thereof. The stretch rod is further actuated to be urged against the closed end, thereby resulting in stretching the preform.After the stretching phase has been initiated a liquid is injected into the preform through its open end thanks to the injection head, as disclosed for instance in Applicant's patent EP 1 529 620 B1. Upon command, the injection valve is caused to be opened, thereby enabling flow of liquid therethrough and injection of liquid into the preform. This liquid injection causes expansion of the preform until coming into contact with the inner walls of the mold, thereby achieving the final shape of the bottle.Once the bottle has been blown and filled with liquid, the injection valve is caused to be closed.The Applicant has noticed that a certain amount of liquid (residual liquid) is still present in the space located between the closed injection valve and the bottle.When the injection head is lifted up and/or the mold is opened to remove the blown and filled bottle residual liquid that has accumulated within the above-mentioned space splashes all around and, therefore, is wasted.Also, liquid spreads all over the inner walls of the mold.Liquid drops which are present on the mold inner walls have to be removed before accommodating a new preform inside the mold. Otherwise, the presence of liquid drops may impair defects in the outside surface of the next blown and filled container.It is to be noted that the above situation also arises with other blow-molding methods and for other kinds of containers.There is therefore a need for an apparatus remedying at least one of the above-mentioned drawbacks.In this respect, the invention is an apparatus for blowing and filling a plastic container from a preform and using a liquid as the blowing medium. The apparatus includes a liquid collecting member for collecting residual liquid that is present between the injection head and the neck of the blown and liquid filled container.The residual liquid is the liquid overflow that remains around the neck of the container after it has been filled with liquid.The invention makes provision for liquid collecting means which are suitable for collecting the residual liquid before opening the mold and/or raising the injection head. These means may be integrated into the apparatus.According to a possible feature, the liquid collecting means are provided at least partially in the injection head and/or the mold.Thus, the liquid collecting means may be integrated in whole or in part in the injection head or in the mold.Alternatively, the liquid collecting means may be integrated in both the injection head and the mold so as to increase the efficiency of the liquid collecting operation.According to a possible feature, the liquid collecting means comprise at least one collecting channel that is operable to be in communication with said residual liquid.Such means are efficient by virtue of their simple conception.According to possible feature, the liquid collecting means comprise a plurality of collecting channels that are operable to be in communication with said residual liquid.According to the needs and/or the arrangement of the apparatus, a plurality of collecting channels may be envisaged rather than a single collecting channel.It is to be noted that integrating the liquid collecting means in the injection head and/or the mold provides the advantage of having a compact apparatus with a reduced bulkiness.For instance, the at least one collecting channel is a sucking channel.Thus, the liquid is sucked in through the at least one sucking channel, e.g. thanks to a pump device located upstream said channel.Alternatively, the liquid may be collected within the at least one collecting channel by gravity, which therefore does not necessitate using any sucking means. In this embodiment the at least one collecting channel is integrated in part in the mold and in the injection head.According to another possible feature, the collecting channels are spatially arranged around the space that is located between the injection head and the neck of the blown and liquid-filled container.Such an arrangement proves to be easy and quite efficient for getting access to the zone where the residual liquid to be collected is present.According to another possible feature, the at least one collecting channel is inclined relative to a longitudinal axis passing by the centre of the neck of the blown and liquid-filled container.The inclination of the at least one collecting channel is particularly useful when collecting the residual liquid through gravity.According to a possible feature, the at least one collecting channel has two opposite ends of which one is in communication with the space that is located between the injection head and the neck of the blown and the liquid-filled container.The possible inclination of the at least one collecting channel makes it easier to locate the communicating end of said channel in the lower part of the space that surrounds the neck of the container.This advantage is obtained with liquid collecting channels provided in the injection head and/or the mold of the apparatus.According to a possible feature, the liquid collecting means comprise at least one valve device that is able to prevent the residual liquid from being evacuated through said at least one collecting channel when in a closed position.In an open position of said at least one valve device the residual liquid may be circulated through said at least one collecting channel either by sucking or gravity.The at least one value valve device may be connected to the at least one collecting channel.Said at least one valve device is located at the end of the channel which is opposite the end that is in communication with the space where the residual liquid is present.According to a further possible feature, the at least one valve device is by default in a closed position that prevents liquid from being collected through said at least one collecting channel.The role of the at least one closed valve device is to avoid any flow of liquid through the channel, for instance, when the liquid injection phase is operated and liquid collecting is not operated.According to a possible feature, the number of collecting channels and/or their possible inclination relative to a longitudinal axis passing by the centre of the neck of the blown and liquid filled container and are adapted to the volume of the residual liquid to be collected.In other words, the volume of the residual liquid to be collected depends on the space between the injection head and the neck of the container.According to a possible feature, the injection head comprises a longitudinal body accommodating in a housing thereof an injection valve, the longitudinal body extending longitudinally beyond said housing through a body extension that surrounds an inner cavity facing the injection valve, the inner cavity accommodating the protruding neck of the container and the body extension comprising the at least one collecting channel.The arrangement of the liquid collecting means within the body extension proves to be simple and efficient.According to a possible feature, the end of the at least one collecting channel that is in communication with the space between the injection head and the neck of the container is in a lower position than the opposite end of said at least one collecting channel. Alternatively, the end communicating with the space is substantially at the same level as the opposite end.Thus, the end of the at least one collecting channel in communication with the space where the residual liquid is present may be located at the basis or in the lower part of the space so as to increase the efficiency of the liquid collecting operation.This feature is suitable for an embodiment where the liquid collecting means are provided in the injection head.According to a possible feature, the at least one collecting channel is provided in part in the mold and in the injection head.According to a possible feature, the at least one collecting channel has two parts one of which is provided in the mold and the other part in the injection head, said at least one collecting channel having an end that opens into the space located between the injection head and the neck of the blown and liquid-filled container.Thus the part of the at least one collecting channel that is integrated within the injection head has the opening end.According to a possible feature, the opening end of the at least one collecting channel is in an upper position than the opposite end of said at least one channel when the latter is partly provided in the mold and in the injection head.This inclination makes it possible to favor the collection of liquid through the at least one collecting channel.This arrangement is of particular interest when liquid collecting is to be carried out through gravity only.According to a possible feature, the neck of the container has a neck ring at the basis thereof and the injection head is in a sealing engagement with the neck ring.According to a possible feature, the opening end of the at least one collecting channel opens into a region of the injection head that is located close to the basis of the neck.Such an arrangement makes it possible to locate the end of the at least one collecting channel as close as possible to the lower part of the space where the residual liquid is present. This arrangement enhances efficiency of the liquid collecting operation.According to a possible feature, the mold comprises two halves, said at least one collecting channel being partially provided in at least one of the two mold halves.For an increased efficiency, a plurality of collecting channels may be distributed into the two mold halves so as to more completely surround the above space with the residual liquid.According to a possible feature, the apparatus comprises means for recycling the residual liquid that has been collected.Thus, it is possible to recycle the collected liquid and, therefore, reduce or avoid waste of liquid in the process of blowing and liquid filling containers.According to a possible feature, the apparatus comprises compressed air injection means for injecting compressed air into the space between the injection head and the neck of the blown and liquid filled container.Such means are suitable, when activated, for cooperating with the liquid collecting means and help to collect the residual liquid that is present within the space around the container neck.Thus, the efficiency of the liquid collecting operation is enhanced.Additional features and advantages are described herein, and will be apparent from the following Detailed Description and the figures.Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying figures in which:FIG. 1 is a schematic and partial view of an apparatus for blowing and filling a container according to a first embodiment;FIG. 2 is schematic view of a liquid circuit system in connection with the injection head of FIG. 1 apparatus;FIG. 3 is a schematic and partial view of an apparatus for blowing and filling a container according to a second embodiment.FIG. 1 is a schematic and partial view illustrating the main components of an apparatus 10 for blowing and filling a container according to a first embodiment.The apparatus 10 comprises a mold 12 enclosing a container 14 such as a bottle. Mold 12 comprises two mold halves 12a and 12b that are operable to move apart in order to extract container 14. The mold may comprise more than two parts and for instance a base on which rests the container.A bottle which has been manufactured through blow molding or stretch-blow molding comprises a dispensing opening 16 having a neck 18 with an outside thread and a flange or neck ring 20 that is provided at the basis of the neck.As represented in FIG. 1, a longitudinal axis A which here coincides with the vertical axis, passes by the centre of dispensing opening 16.It is to be noted that axis A is a symmetry axis to container 14.The container has been shaped so that the dispensing opening 16 protrudes from the upper surface 12c of mold 12 above the latter.In particular, neck ring 20 rests against a peripheral inner shoulder 22 provided at the upper part of the mold around the container 14.Apparatus 10 also comprises an injection head 24 which comes into sealing engagement (liquid-tight engagement) with the upper surface 12c of mold 12 before the beginning of the blowing and filling method and, in the course of operation thereof. Injection head 24 is also in a sealing engagement with container 14, more particularly with neck ring 20.Injection head 24 comprises a longitudinal body 25 and an injection valve 26 provided in an inner housing 28 of said longitudinal body.Injection head 24 is substantially cylindrical in shape as partially illustrated in FIG. 1 and inner housing 28 is also cylindrical in shape and both are coaxial.Injection head 24 and mold 12 are substantially aligned along longitudinal axis A.As represented in FIG. 1, body 25 further extends longitudinally along longitudinal axis A through a longitudinal body 30 that extends beyond housing 28 and injection valve 26.Body extension 30 is substantially annular in shape and, for example, takes the form of a cylindrically-shaped extending wall with a frusto-conical shape on part of its outside surface.Body extension 30 surrounds an inner cavity 32 which faces housing 28 and injection valve 26. Inner cavity 32 accommodates the protruding neck 18 of container 14 which is engaged thereinto.Body extension 30 has a free end 30a which comprises a sealing or liquid-tight end surface, perpendicular to axis A and which is in sealing engagement with upper surface 12c and neck ring 20.FIG. 1 apparatus 10 also includes liquid collecting means for collecting the residual liquid that is present inside cavity 32, after blowing and liquid filling of container 14 as will be explained subsequently.In the present embodiment liquid collecting means are provided in injection head 24.Liquid collecting means comprise a plurality of liquid collecting channels two of which, 34 and 36, are represented in FIG. 1.These channels are spatially arranged, e.g. regularly, around inner cavity or space 32 and, more particularly, are integrated into body extension 30.As represented in FIG. 1, each channel has two opposite ends 34a and 34b, 36a and 36b. A first end 34a, 36a opens into inner cavity 32 so as to be in communication therewith while the opposite second end 34b, 36b opens onto the outside surface of body 25.Each channel is inclined relative to longitudinal axis A so that the first end 34a, 36a is in a lower position than the opposite second end 34b, 36b. The apparatus further comprises valve devices 38, 40 that are located facing the opposite ends 34b, 36b respectively and connected thereto.These valve devices which are for example in a corresponding number with the collecting channels are by default in a closed state which prevents any flow of liquid therethrough.Arranging the valve devices outside the injection head does not question the conception thereof and proves to be easy and cheap to implement.As represented in FIGS. 1 and 2, apparatus 10 comprises pipes or ducts 42, 44 that respectively connect each channel 34, 36 to a pump device 46. Pump device 46 is, in turn, connected through a connecting duct or pipe 48 to a tank or reservoir of liquid 50 that will be used for supplying liquid during the next liquid injection phase. It is to be noted that pipes or ducts 42 and 44 are part of liquid collecting means.Alternatively, the members 38 and 40 which are connected to the collecting channels may be connectors and the valve devices (not represented in the drawing) may be located upstream said connectors on the respective pipes or ducts 42, 44.It is to be noted that the number of collecting channels may vary and, for example, be greater than two or even equal to one.Also, the angle of inclination of the channels may vary as well as their shape.Typically, the number of channels and their inclination depend on the volume of liquid to be collected. This amount of liquid may be assessed based on the volume of the space surrounding the container neck 18 within cavity 32.The inclination of the channel(s) relative to a plane that is perpendicular to axis A may be relatively small or even null provided that:the opening end (34a, 36a) is located in the lower part of cavity 32 (close to neck ring 20),the space around the opposite end (34b, 36b) is sufficient for arranging a valve device or a connector in contact with said opposite end.For example, a channel may have a substantially cylindrical hollow shape.In the present embodiment two to six channels for example four channels, are arranged within body extension 30 around cavity 32. Each channel has an inner diameter lying between 2 and 8 mm and, for example, being equal to 4 mm.The angle of inclination of each channel relative to an horizontal plane lies between 5 and 60°.In order to reduce the bulkiness of the channel arrangement within the injection head the angle of inclination may preferably be between 5 and 30°.This second range of inclination angles also makes the liquid collecting easier.Alternatively, other shapes of channels may be envisaged.For example, a single channel may be provided around the whole circumference of body extension 30 (viewed in a transverse cross-section that is perpendicular to FIG. 1 plane) with the same longitudinal cross-section as that of FIG. 1 or with another cross-sectional shape. Thus, the single channel may have an overall frusto-conical shape. Alternatively, angularly extended and separated portions of channels may be spatially arranged around the circumference of body extension 30.In this embodiment container 14 is a plastic container which has been manufactured according to a known method such as disclosed in Applicant's patent EP 1 529 620 B1.According to this method, a plastic preform is first manufactured through a molding process and then heated before being positioned within mold 12.The preform usually assumes the shape of a cylindrical tube closed at its bottom end and open at its opposite end.Once the preform has been positioned within the mold only the open end of preform is visible from above the mold. The open end is engaged within cavity 32.The open end is shaped during the process, thereby leading to dispensing opening 16.The blowing and filling process makes use of a stretch rod (this rod is not represented in the drawing but traverses the injection valve 26) which is downwardly engaged into the open end of the preform so as to come into contact with the closed bottom end thereof. The stretch rod is then further actuated to push the closed end downwardly and stretch the preform accordingly in a controlled manner.After the stretching phase has been initiated the liquid mentioned above (e.g. water) is injected into the preform through its open end around the stretch rod, while the latter is still being actuated. For liquid injection purpose injection valve 26 is placed in an upper position away from the inner surface 28a so as to enable flow of liquid between valve 26 and surface 28a. Valve devices 38 and 40 are closed.This liquid injection causes expansion of the preform together with the movement of the stretch rod until coming into contact with the inner walls of the mold.The final shape of the container is thus achieved.Once container 14 has been blown and filled with liquid, injection valve 26 is commanded to be lowered against inner surface 28a (position of FIG. 1) in a sealing engagement therewith, so as to prevent any further flow of liquid into container 14 and ensure liquid-tight sealing.The inner cavity 32 contains residual liquid that is located around neck 18 and represents an overflow that has not been injected into container 14 following the liquid injection phase. When the channels are inclined, the residual liquid remains within cavity 32 and does not fill the channels.In order to avoid such a liquid overflow to be wasted when moving the injection head away from the mold and opening the latter the liquid collecting channels act as sucking channels. Valve devices 38 and 40 are commanded to be opened and pump device 46 is commanded to operate and causes, by depression, the liquid overflow (residual liquid) to rise up inside sucking channels and pipes 42 and 44.The overflow extracted in this way is then supplied to tank 50. The recovered or collected liquid overflow is then stored within a view to being recycled in the course of the next liquid injection phase.As schematically illustrated in dotted lines in FIG. 1, optional means for injecting compressed air within cavity 32 are provided. When being activated such injected compressed air pushes the residual liquid into the collecting channels (when liquid collecting is operated) and, therefore, contribute to collecting the residual liquid. This contributes to increasing the efficiency of the liquid collecting operation and reducing the cycle time of the process.These injection means may cooperate with liquid collecting channels which operate under the action of a sucking device, e.g. a pump device.Alternatively, these injection means may be used when the liquid collecting channels are less, or even not, inclined relative to an horizontal plane and no sucking device is used. The only power used for evacuating the residual liquid through the collecting channels is that supplied by the compressed air emerging into the cavity 32 and expelling the liquid into said channels.It is to be noted that the injection means may take the form of channels such as channels 52 and 54 which bring compressed air down to cavity 32 from a source of compressed air that is not represented in the drawing for the sake of clarity.These channels may be inclined relative to axis A and, e.g. have the same inclination or same arrangement with no inclination as that of channels 34 and 36 for easiness of manufacturing.The outlet end of each channel may be located at any place along the height of cavity 32.FIG. 3 illustrates a second embodiment of an apparatus for blowing and liquid filling containers.As represented in FIG. 3, an apparatus 60 for blowing and filling a container 14 comprises a mold 62 and an injection head 64.Injection head 64 is almost the same as injection head 24 except that it does not contain collecting channels 34 and 36 and their associated components (valve devices, pipes, etc.).Mold 62 is almost identical to mold 12 in that it comprises two mold halves 62a and 62b enclosing container 14.Neck 18 of container 14 protrudes from the upper surface 62c of the mold and penetrates into inner cavity 32 of injection head 64.The free end 30a of injection head 64 is in sealing engagement with upper surface 62c and neck ring 20.As represented in FIG. 3, the apparatus comprises liquid collecting means which are provided both in mold 62 and injection head 64.More particularly, liquid collecting means comprise a plurality of inclined liquid collecting channels two of which, 66 and 68, are represented in FIG. 3.The plurality of channels are integrated into the two mold halves and the injection head. For example, they are arranged with a regular spatial spacing viewed in a transverse cross-section relative to axis A.Each channel has two channel parts which are aligned with each other, one channel part being provided in one mold half and the other channel part in the injection head.Thus, channel 66 (resp. 68) comprises a first part 66a (resp. 68a) integrated within mold half 62a (resp. 62b) and a second part 66b (resp. 68b) integrated within body extension 30.Liquid-tight means are provided around the joint surface between the two channel parts 66a, 66b (resp. 68a, 68b) in order to prevent any leak of liquid. For instance, a toroidal gasket seal 67, 69 is arranged in the injection head around the joint surface of channel 66, 68 respectively.Each channel 66, 68 has two opposite ends 66c and 66d, 68c and 68d. One of the two opposite ends 66c, 68c (inlet) is in an upper position than the opposite end 66d, 68d (outlet) and emerges into the upper surface 62c of the mold.As represented in FIG. 3, the emerging end 66c, 68c of each collecting channel is located in the region of the cavity 32 that surrounds the neck 18 and, more particularly, in the lower part thereof.As shown in FIG. 3, the emerging ends are located at the basis of the neck 18 and above the neck ring 20.Neck ring 20 rests against a peripheral inner shoulder 70 provided at the upper part of the mold around container 14.As for FIG. 1 collecting channels 34 and 36, collecting channels 66 and 68 are inclined relative to longitudinal axis A.As for the FIG. 1 embodiment, the number of collecting channels, their angle of inclination as well as their shape may vary depending on the amount of residual liquid present within inner cavity 32. The same remarks as those provided above relative to the first embodiment also apply here and will not be repeated.In FIG. 3 embodiment two to six channels, for example four channels, may be distributed all around cavity 32 both in the mold halves and body extension 30.Each channel has an inner diameter which lies between 4 and 8 mm and, for example, is equal to 6 mm. This range of values is greater than that of FIG. 1 embodiment so as to be more adapted when gravity liquid collecting is used. However, if compressed air is injected into cavity 32 the inner diameter of the channels may be the same as for FIG. 1 channels.Furthermore, the angle of inclination of each two-part channel is smaller than that of the FIG. 1 channels in order to avoid any interference between the part of the channel located in the mold half and the shape of the container (profile of the inner walls of each mold half).Thus, the angle of inclination of each two-part channel relative to an horizontal plane lies between 5 and 45° and, for instance, is equal to 30°.The apparatus further comprises valve devices 72, 74 which are respectively located facing outlets 66b, 68b of collecting channels 66 and 68 and are connected thereto. These valve devices are closed by default.Ducts or pipes 76, 78 are respectively connected to valve devices 72 and 74 at one end and to pump device 46 of FIG. 2 at the opposite end.The same remarks as those made in relation to valve devices 38 and 40 in FIG. 1 apply here and will not be repeated.The liquid collecting and recycling means represented in FIG. 2 (liquid circuit system) may also be used in conjunction with FIG. 3 embodiment.Once container 14 has been blown and liquid-filled, injection valve 26 is commanded to be lowered against inner surface 28a (position of FIG. 3), in a sealing engagement therewith so as to prevent any further flow of liquid into container 14 and ensure liquid-tight sealing.The residual liquid or liquid overflow that is located within cavity 32 around neck 18 following the liquid injection phase is collected through liquid collecting channels 66 and 68.These collecting channels behave as sucking channels when valve devices 72 and 74 are commanded to be opened and pump device 46 of FIG. 3 is commanded to operate by causing depression in the upstream circuit.This will then cause the liquid overflow to be sucked into channels 66 and 68 and pipes 76 and 78 until reaching pump device 46.The collected residual liquid is then supplied by pump device 46 to tank 50 for being stored before any recycling.Since a pump device is used in this embodiment the angle of inclination of the channels may be much smaller than 30° relative to the horizontal plane, e.g. in the order of several degrees.According to an alternative embodiment, no pump device is necessary for collecting the liquid. As the collecting channels 66 and 68 are inclined relative to axis A with the outlet ends located in a lower position than the inlet ends 66c, 68c, the liquid may be collected by gravity inside the channels when valve devices 72 and 74 are caused to be opened and venting to the atmosphere is performed.The collected liquid may then be further conveyed by gravity to a tank or reservoir as tank 50 of FIG. 2 for subsequently recycling the liquid during another injection phase.It is to be noted that valve devices are present in the liquid circuit in order to prevent any gravitational flowing of liquid into the collecting channels during the liquid injection phase.As for FIG. 1 embodiment compressed air injection means may be used in connection with FIG. 3 embodiment.According to a first variant embodiment, compressed air may be used with FIG. 3 embodiment in which a pump device is involved to extract the residual liquid so as to enhance the efficiency of the liquid collecting operation.According to a second variant embodiment, compressed air may be used with FIG. 3 embodiment in which the residual liquid is collected through the collecting channels thanks to gravity. This dramatically reduces the time necessary for collecting the liquid and therefore the cycle time of the whole process.All that has been described above in connection with FIG. 1 embodiment still applies here and will not be repeated.Thanks to liquid collecting means waste of liquid is dramatically reduced in the course of performance of the blowing and filling method.Furthermore, the presence of liquid drops within the mold and, in particular, on the inner surface of the walls of the two mold halves is dramatically reduced or even avoided.It should be understood that various changes and modifications to the presently preferred embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

The base includes a concave annular wall extending from the container sidewall to a standing surface, and an inner wall extending from the standing surface to a substantially flat inner annular wall. The inner annular wall is recessed in the base and is substantially perpendicular to the container sidewall. The inner annular wall includes a centrally located dimple. The dimple includes a plurality of spaced apart and radially extending indented ribs. One or more of the ribs extend radially into a brace that tapers to meet the inner annular wall.The present application is a division of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/250,856 filed Oct. 14, 2008, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,381,496, which is a division of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/851,083 filed May 24, 2004, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,543,713, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/444,616 (U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2003/0196926) (abandoned) filed on May 23, 2003, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/124,734 filed on Apr. 17, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,612,451, which claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/284,795 filed on Apr. 19, 2001. Additionally, PCT application PCT/US2004/016405 filed May 24, 2004 also claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/444,616 (U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2003/0196926) (abandoned). The contents of each of the foregoing are incorporated by reference in their entirety.The present invention relates to a base for a wide mouth blow-molded plastic container, and more particularly, the present invention relates to a multi-functional base structure which enables use of the container in hot-fill, as well as pasteurization/retort processing.Plastic blow-molded containers, particularly those molded of PET, have been utilized in hot fill applications where the container is filled with a liquid product heated to a temperature in excess of 180° F. (82° C.), capped immediately after filling, and allowed to cool to ambient temperatures. Plastic blow-molded containers have also been utilized in pasteurization and retort processes, where a filled and sealed container is subjected to thermal processing and is then cooled to ambient temperatures. Pasteurization and retort methods are frequently used for sterilizing solid or semi-solid food products, e.g., pickles and sauerkraut, which may be packed into the container along with a liquid at a temperature less than 82° C. (180° F.) and then heated, or the product placed in the container that is then filled with liquid, which may have been previously heated, and the entire contents subsequently heated to a higher temperature. Pasteurization and retort differ from hot-fill processing by including heating the contents of a filled container to a specified temperature, typically greater than 93° C. (200° F.), until the contents reach a specified temperature, for example 80° C. (175° F.), for a predetermined length of time. Retort processes also involve applying overpressure to the container. In each of these cases, the plastic containers are typically provided with vacuum absorption panels to accommodate volumetric changes in the container as the contents of the sealed container are heated and/or as the contents cool within the sealed container.U.S. Pat. No. 6,439,413 issued to Prevot et al. and assigned to Graham Packaging Company, L.P. discloses a hot-fillable and retortable plastic wide-mouth blow-molded container having a sidewall with a pair of flex panels.Co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.

The above cited U.S. patents disclose containers having various base structures.The structure of a so-called footed base is disclosed, in general, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,355,728 issued to Yoshino et al., 5,713,480 issued to Petre et al., 3,727,783 issued to Carmichael, 4,318,489 issued to Snyder et al., 5,133,468 issued to Brunson et al., 5,024,340 issued to Alberghini et al., 3,935,955 issued to Das, 4,892,205, 4,867,323 and Re. 35,140 issued to Powers et al., and 5,785,197 issued to Slat.U.S. Pat. No. 4,321,483 issued to Dechenne et al. discloses a base having slightly angled annular surface and a central conical projection; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,386,701 issued to Galer discloses a blow molded plastic drum having a base which is designed to stack efficiently with the lid of a like drum.Plastic containers, including those described in the above-mentioned references, containers, including containers designed for use in hot-fill processing. There remains a need to provide plastic containers that can withstand the rigors of pasteurization and retort processing in order to take advantage of the cost savings that can be realized through manufacture and recycling. The lighter weight of plastic containers as compared to glass can also advantageously reduce shipping costs.Published International Application No. WO 02/02418 describes a container with a base that can be capable of withstanding the rigors of the pasteurization process. The base includes a large push up section formed with a sharp transition to the container sidewall. The base also must be heat set to a relatively high crystallinity.While the above referenced containers and base structures may function satisfactorily for their intended purposes, there is a need for a plastic, wide-mouth, blow-molded container which is particularly suited for packaging a variety of viscous and other food products and which has a novel base structure that enables the container to be utilized in hot-fill, pasteurization and retort processes. The base structure should be capable of accommodating increased internal pressure experienced during pasteurization; capable of accommodating vacuum formed in the sealed container during cool down; and capable of resisting unwanted inversion, ovalization or like deformation. A container capable of efficient stacking with like containers is also desirable.With the foregoing in mind, an object of the present invention is to provide a commercially satisfactory wide-mouth blow-molded container that can be utilized in hot-fill applications, as well as for pasteurization or retort applications used in for packaging fluent, viscous and solid food products.Another object of the present invention is to provide a base structure capable of accommodating an increase in internal container pressure when the sealed container is subjected to thermal treatment, and capable of accommodating vacuum during cool down.Still another object of the present invention is to provide a hot-fillable and pasteurizable container having a base which accommodates changes in internal pressure and volume and which resists unwanted inversion and other deformation.A further object of the present invention is to provide a structure for a wide-mouth plastic container which can be efficiently stacked, one on top of the other, with like containers and which can be produced by means of high speed manufacturing equipment in an economical mariner that ensures consistent quality and performance.More specifically, the present invention provides a blow molded plastic container having a base with a continuous or discontinuous concave outer annular wall having an outer portion and an inner portion forming a standing ring therebetween. The base also includes an inner annular wall that extends within the outer annular wall and above the standing ring. The inner periphery of the inner annular wall is made of blow molded plastic material that is heat-set and biaxially-oriented and connects to an anti-inverting central dimple. Functionally, the inner annular wall is capable of flexing upwardly and downwardly in response to variations in pressures in a filled and sealed container without undergoing unwanted permanent deformation. In addition, preferably a shoulder extends radially inward on the inner portion of the outer annular wall above a level of the standing ring to facilitate vertical stacking of containers having like bases.In a particular embodiment, the container includes a body having an integrally formed base that includes a concave annular wall extending from a sidewall of the container to a standing surface, an inner wall that is substantially perpendicular to the sidewall and extends from the standing surface to a substantially flat inner annular wall. The concave annular wall can be continuous. A dimple is centrally located within the inner annular wall and includes a plurality of spaced apart radially extending indented ribs. Each rib has a brace that extends radially from the dimple and tapers to meet the inner annular wall. The ribs can also include a rib wall; and a brace ledge tapering from the rib wall to the inner annular wall, a rib wall; and a brace ledge tapering from said rib wall to the inner annular wall. A brace sidewall extending from said brace ledge to said inner annular wall.The container can be made of a blow molded plastic material, and the degree of crystallinity of the plastic material in the base is greater than the degree of crystallinity of the plastic material in the sidewall. The degree crystallinity in the base can be greater than 20% an can be less than 30%. The sidewall diameter can be no more than 50% greater than the inner diameter of the standing surface.The inner annular wall of the base is adapted to flex upwardly and downwardly in response to variations in pressures within the container, when capped and filled, without undergoing unwanted permanent deformation.The invention is also a method of improving resistance to base deformation in a blow molded plastic container comprising forming a concave annular wall extending from an extremity of the base to a standing surface, forming an inner wall extending from the standing surface to a substantially flat inner annular wall that is substantially perpendicular to the sidewall; and forming a centrally located dimple within the inner annular wall and a plurality of spaced apart radially extending indented ribs, each of the ribs comprising a brace extending radially from the dimple and tapering to meet the inner annular wall.The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention should become apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a container having a base according to an embodiment of the present invention;FIG. 2 is an elevational view of the container illustrated in FIG. 1;FIG. 3 is bottom plan view of the base illustrated in FIG. 1;FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of the base taken along line IV-IV of FIG. 3;FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view of the base taken along line V-V of FIG. 2 and illustrates a pair of containers in a stacked arrangement;FIG. 6 is a perspective view of a container having a base according to another embodiment of the invention;FIG. 7 is a bottom view of the base according to the embodiment illustrated inFIG. 6;FIG. 8 is a cross-section of the base of FIG. 6 taken along the VIII-VIII line of FIG. 7;FIG. 9 is a cross-section of the base of FIG. 6 taken along the line IX-IX of FIG. 7;FIG. 10 is a perspective view of a container having a base embodying the present invention;FIG. 11 is an elevational view of the container illustrated in FIG. 10;FIG. 12 is bottom plan view of the base illustrated in FIG. 10;FIG. 13 is a cross-sectional view of the base taken along line 4-4 of FIG. 12; andFIG. 14 is a cross-sectional view of the base taken along line 5-5 of FIG. 11 and illustrates a pair of containers in a stacked arrangement.An embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in FIGS. 1-5 as container 100. Container 100 has a base 112, a tubular sidewall 114, and a wide-mouth threaded finish 116 which projects from the upper end of the sidewall 114 via a shoulder 118. In the illustrated embodiment, upper and lower label bumpers, 120 and 122, are located adjacent the shoulder 118 and base 112, respectfully, and outline a substantially cylindrical label area 124 on the sidewall 114. Containers according to the invention can have cross-sectional shapes other than circular. In addition, the sidewall 114 can have a series of circumferential grooves 126 which reinforce the sidewall 114 and resist paneling, dents and other unwanted deformation of the sidewall 114.The container 100 is multi-functional since it can be utilized in hot-fill as well as pasteurization and retort processing. To accomplish this objective, the base 112 has a structure which is capable of accommodating elevated internal container pressure experienced during pasteurization or retort processing, and which is capable of accommodating reduced container volume and pressure experienced upon cool down of a filled and sealed container after hot-fill, pasteurization or retort processing. To this end, the base 112 can flex downwardly in a controlled mariner and to a desired extent when pressure within the filled and sealed container is elevated, and the base 112 can flex upwardly in a controlled manner and to a desired extent when a vacuum develops within the filled and sealed container.Structurally, the base 112 includes a concave outer annular wall 128 that is either continuous or discontinuous. FIGS. 1-5 illustrate an embodiment of the base 112 having a discontinuous concave outer annular wall 128 that provides a plurality of spaced-apart, arcuate supports 130 adjacent the outer periphery 132 of the base 112. Each support 130 has an outer wall portion 134 that extends upwardly toward the lower label bumper 122 and an inner wall portion 136 that extends upwardly and inwardly into the remaining base structure as will be discussed. A standing surface 138 is formed at the juncture of each outer and inner wall portions, 134 and 136, thereby forming a discontinuous support ring of the container 100. FIGS. 6-9 illustrate an embodiment of a base 212 having a continuous concave outer annular wall 228 that forms a continuous standing surface 238, as described more fully below.An inner annular wall 140 of base 112 extends within the concave outer annular wall 128. The inner annular wall 140 has an outer periphery 142 and an inner periphery 144. The outer periphery 142 of the inner annular wall 140 merges with the inner wall portion 136 of each of the supports 130 and, in the illustrated embodiment, with a plurality of spaced-apart, horizontally-disposed, radial webs 146 located adjacent the outer periphery 132 of the base 112. Each of the webs 146 extends between the supports 130 and connects to the container sidewall 114 at an elevation above the horizontal plane “P” extending through the standing surface 138. In an embodiment of the present invention in which the concave outer annular wall 128 is continuous, webs 146 are not provided. The inner periphery 144 of the inner annular wall 140 merges into an anti-inverting central dimple 148.The inner annular wall 140 functions as a flex panel. To this end, when the internal pressure increases within a filled and sealed container, the inner annular wall 140 flexes downwardly to accommodate the increased pressure and to prevent the sidewall 114 of the container 100 from undergoing unwanted permanent distortion. In addition, the inner annular wall 140 flexes upwardly to relieve vacuum when the contents of a hot filled and capped container, or a filled, capped and subsequently pasteurized container, cool to ambient. Thus, when the sealed container and contents cool to ambient temperature, the sidewall 114 is substantially unchanged from its as-formed shape and is capable of neatly supporting a wrap-around label without unwanted voids or the like beneath the label. In addition, the sidewall 114 resists ovalization and the base 112 provides a level seating surface which is not subject to rocking or the like.The base 112 of container 100 is specifically designed to provide flexural movement. Increasing flexure of the base 112 is accomplished by providing a larger circular flat between the dimple 148 and the arcuate supports 130. Thus, the inner annular wall 140 of container 100 is relatively large compared to other containers of a similar size. To this end, the diameter, size, or extent of the central dimple 148 is reduced and the inner diameter of the arcuate supports 130 is increased relative to prior art container.The relatively large flat surface provided by inner annular wall 140 provides greater flexure; however, it can also be more prone to “roll out”, i.e. becoming permanently deformed in an outwardly projecting position when its contents are hot-filled or heated at relatively high temperatures, such as those encountered during pasteurization or retort processing. This is because an amorphous ring of material is created at the interconnection of the inner periphery 144 of the inner annular wall 140 and the dimple 148 due to the reduced size of the dimple 148. This ring of un oriented, non heat-set material provides a weakened area that permits the base to “roll out” when filled and sealed with contents at high temperatures.The base 112 of the present invention overcomes the “roll out” problem by providing a series of spaced-apart, radially-extending, hollow, indented ribs 150 in the dimple 148 where the inner periphery 144 of the inner annular wall 140 interconnects to the central dimple 148. The structure provided by the ribs 150 causes the material in this region to be stretched during blow molding of the container 100 so that the ring of material adjacent the interconnection of the dimple 148 and inner annular wall 140 is both heat-set and the extent of biaxial orientation increased to structurally reinforce the base and prevent “roll out” of the base 112. If desired, the dimple 148 can be indented to a given extent into the container 100 to provide additional stretching, and the total number of ribs 150 can be three or more, such as six as illustrated in FIG. 1. In addition, the shape and size of the ribs can vary as long as the blow molded plastic material forming the base at the interconnection of the dimple 148 and inner annular wall 140 has sufficiently increased biaxial orientation and is heat-set by heated surfaces of a blow mold.Thus, the inner annular wall 140 flexes downwardly when the container is filled, capped and subjected to an increase in pressure within the container. However, complete inversion and failure is prevented by the reinforcement ribs 150 formed in the dimple 148, which travel with the inner annular wall 140. The ribs 150 and dimple 148 maintain a substantially constant shape regardless of the internal pressure experienced within the container, due to the increase in density and stiffness resulting from the increased orientation.Another feature of the base 112 of the present invention is that each inner wall portion 136 of the arcuate supports 130 can have an arcuate shoulder, or support ridge, 156 formed therein and spaced in elevation from both the support surfaces 138 and the inner annular wall 140 to facilitate vertical stacking of like containers 100. For example, as illustrated FIG. 5, an upper container 100a can be stacked on a lower container 100b. The support ridge 156 in the base 112a of the upper container 100a seats on the outer edge 158 of the upper surface 160 of the lid 162 of the lower container 100b such that the horizontal plane “Pa” extending through the standing surfaces 138a of the upper container 100a extends a spaced distance beneath the top surface 160 of the lid 162 of the lower container 100b. By way of example, and not by way of limitation, the container 100 according to the present invention preferably has a height “H” of about 5.8 inches, a container outermost diameter “D” of about 4.2 inches, and can contain a capacity of about 32 fluid ounces. The discontinuous standing ring formed by the standing surfaces 38 has a diameter of about 3.7 inches, and the inner annular wall 140 of the base 112 has an inner periphery 144 with a diameter of less than about 1.25 inches and an outer periphery 142 with a diameter of at least about 2.5 inches. The radial webs 146 are uniformly spaced apart and separate each support 130 such that each support 130 is at least about 0.8 radians. In addition, each support 130 has a larger arcuate extent than that of each radial web 146.FIGS. 6-9 illustrate a second embodiment of a base 212 that may be used on a container 200 according to the present invention. Other than the base 212, the container 200 can be the same as or different from container 100. Accordingly, the last two digits in reference numerals used to designate features of the container 200 are the same as the reference numerals that are used to designate the related features in container 100. For example, the container 200 can include a threaded finish 216 that can be the same as the threaded finish 116 of the first embodiment, and can accommodate a closure 262 having complementary threads. Similarly, the shoulder 218, upper bumper 220, circumferential grooves 226, label area 224, and sidewall 214 can be structurally similar to the corresponding features of the first embodiment.The second embodiment of the base 212 includes a continuous concave outer annular sidewall 228. The outer portion 228 of the annular sidewall curves from the sidewall 214 toward the center of the container 200 to form a continuous standing surface 238. The standing surface 238 is formed as a continuous, circular surface. Further, the transition from the outer annular sidewall 228 to the standing surface 238 is gradual and continuous. An inner portion 236 of the outer annular sidewall extends from the standing surface 238 to a substantially flat inner annular wall 240. The outer periphery 242 of the inner annular wall 240 forms a continuous ring around the inner annular wall 240.Approximately centrally located on the inner annular wall 240 is a dimple 248. Extending outwardly from the dimple 248 are a series of ribs 250. The dimple 248 of this embodiment can be substantially the same size as the dimple 148 in the first embodiment 100, or can be slightly larger. The ribs 250 of the second embodiment extend outwardly to form a series of radially placed braces 270, which taper to an elevation that meets the flat inner annular wall 240 before, near, or the outer periphery 242 of the inner annular wall. In the illustrated embodiment, the ribs 250 first extend outward from the dimple at a similar depth to the inner portion 272 of the dimple to a rib wall 274, where there is a relatively abrupt change in depth toward the inner annular wall 240. The rib wall 274 extends up to a brace ledge 276 which slopes towards the surface of the inner annular wall 240. The brace ledge 276 can meet the surface of the inner annular wall 240 at or before the outer periphery 242. The sidewall of the brace 278 extends upward from the brace ledge 276 to the surface of the inner annular wall 240. The brace sidewall 278 meets the inner annular wall 240 at a periphery of the brace 270. The sidewall of the brace 278 can be substantially perpendicular to the inner annular wall 240 and the brace ledge 276.The inner annular wall 240 in base 212 flexes in a manner analogous to the inner annular wall 140 of base 112. The radially spaced braces 270 further control flexure of the annular wall 240 in response to the reduced pressures that occur when the container cools down during hot-fill processing, and the reduced and increased pressures that occur during pasteurization and retort processing. The presence of the braces 270 allows greater flexure of the inner annular wall 240 within the concave outer annular wall 228 without allowing permanent deformation of the base. In addition, the presence of a continuous outer annular wall 228 is useful during rigorous pasteurization or retort conditions. Under such conditions, a discontinuous outer sidewall that has feet can have a tendency for the feet to pull in, causing the lower bumper to move into a square shape. By having a continuous standing surface 238 and a continuous outer annular sidewall 228, this tendency is reduced. Further, the presence of a continuous standing surface 238 alleviates any tendency for excessive base rollout.The base structure described herein is illustrated without a support ridge 156 (see FIGS. 1-5) for stacking of containers. Such a ridge or shoulder can, however, be readily incorporated into a base 242 according to this second embodiment of the invention.The base 212 according to the present invention is preferably crystallized to some extent as previously described in the first embodiment. Some degree of crystallinity and biaxial orientation is achieved normally during the blow molding process. Crystallization can also be promoted through heat setting of the container. For example, the walls and base of the mold can be held at an elevated temperature to promote crystallization. When the container is heat set at a temperature of about 180° F., the container sidewalls, base, dome, and threads can be typically crystallized to about 20%. This degree of crystallinity is typical for a blow molding process and does not represent a significant amount of heat setting or increased crystallinity or orientation, as compared with a typically prepared container. However, the properties of the base of the present invention can be advantageously enhanced by heat setting the container, and particularly the base, at ever higher temperatures. Such temperatures can be, for example, greater than 250° F. and can be 325° F. or even higher. When these elevated heat set temperatures are utilized, crystallinity can be increased to greater than 20% or 25% or more. One drawback of increasing crystallinity and biaxial orientation in a plastic container is that this process introduces opacity into the normally clear material. However, unlike bases in prior art containers designed for use in pasteurization and retort processes, which can require a crystallinity of 30% or more, utilizing crystallinities of as low as 22-25% with a base structure according to the present invention can achieve significant structural integrity, while maintaining the substantial clarity of a base that is preferred by manufacturers, packagers and consumers of such pasteurized commodities. Crystallinities of 30% or greater that are frequently utilized in prior container to achieve significant structural integrity can cause undesirable opacity in the base region.Bases formed with configurations according to the present invention provide a more appealing structure to consumers, packagers and manufacturers for other reasons, as well. For example, when switching from the use of glass to plastic in packaging such pasteurizable commodities, design changes cause undesirable changes in the internal container configuration. Typically, in order to withstand the rigors of pasteurization or retort processing, prior containers have included a base formed with a large central push-up, as is used in typical plastic containers used in hot-fill processes. This push-up limits the volume of material that can be placed in the container in the internal region between the push-up and the sidewalls. This can be particularly problematic when solid products, for example, pickles, are packaged. The presence of narrow channels which are formed between the sidewall and large base push-up in the internal space of a typical blow molded container, can limit the volume into which solid materials can be placed. That is, such designs create dead space within the container that can be filled by liquid, but not by the solid product. In traditional glass containers, a relatively flat bottom can be formed which allows solids to be packed throughout the vertical and radial extent of the container. Prior art plastic containers that have been utilized to withstand the pasteurization and retort conditions have used similar internal geometry, which creates dead space.According to the present invention, and particularly according to the second embodiment described herein, the configuration of the base can reduce the amount of dead space and be much more similar to traditionally used glass containers. For example, the substantially flat inner annular wall 240 can extend to a substantial outward extent toward the edge of the container. By using a base configuration according to the present invention, the inner diameter of the standing surface, i.e. the pushed-up region of the base D1, as shown in FIG. 9, can be a relatively large portion of the container diameter D2. According to the present invention, the ratio of the container diameter D2 to the pushed-up diameter D1 can be less than 1.5:1.0 and even 1.3:1.0 or lower. Stated differently, the diameter of the container D2 can be less than 50% larger than, or as little as about 30% larger than, the diameter of D1 of the pushed-up region. In cases where the container is not round, this corresponds to a projected volume of the sidewall region less than 70% greater than the projected area of the push-up region.By way of example, and not by way of limitation, the container 200 according to the present invention can have dimensions similar to those of the container 100. For example, the container can have a height of about 5.8 inches, an outermost diameter D2 of about 3.8 inches, and can contain a capacity of about 32 fluid ounces. The pushed-up region of the base can have a diameter D1 of about 3.1 inches. The brace 270 can have a brace ledge 276 that extends out about 0.6 inches from the dimple 248. The distance between opposite rib walls 274 can be about 1.2 inches, while the distance across the dimple 248 in the region between ribs can be about 0.9 inches.The containers 100 and 200 can be blow molded from an injection molded preform made from, for example, PET, PEN or blends thereof, or can be extrusion blow molded plastic, for example, polypropylene (PP). In addition, the containers 100 and 200 can be multilayered, including a layer of gas barrier material or a layer of scrap material. Resins also include polyester resins modified to improve UV resistance, for example Heatwave™ CF246, available from Voridian (Kingsport, Tenn., U.S.A.). The finishes of the containers can be injection molded, i.e. the threaded portion can be formed as part of the preform, or can be blow molded and severed from an accommodation feature formed thereabove, as is known in the art.The above described containers 100 and 200 are capable of use, for instance, in hot-fill operations having fill temperatures up to about 205° F. As explained above, containers 100 and 200 having base 112 and 212 can be utilized when processing temperatures approach or exceed 205° F. The containers can also be utilized in typical pasteurization processes used in the packaging art. In an exemplary process, a cold solid product, such as pickles, is combined with mildly heated brine at 120 to 140° F. within the container. After the container is capped, the filled container can be processed through a pasteurization tank, where temperatures approach about 212° F., so that the solid products in the sealed container are heated to approximately 175° F. for 15 minutes before the filled and sealed container is cooled to ambient temperature.The present invention provides a container 10 which is particularly suited for use as a jar for packaging food products. For example, the container 10 can be used to package fluent or semi-fluent food products such as applesauce, spaghetti sauce, relishes, sauerkraut, baby foods, and the like. It can also be used to package a solid food product suspended in a liquid brine, such as pickles. Thus, the container 10 can be utilized for packaging various food products and can withstand various fill and treatment operations, as will be discussed.As illustrated in FIG. 10, in one preferred embodiment of the present invention a container 10 is provided having a base 12, a substantially cylindrical sidewall 14, and a wide-mouth threaded finish 16 which projects from the upper end of the sidewall 14 via a shoulder 18. Preferably, as illustrated, upper and lower label bumpers, 20 and 22, are located adjacent the shoulder 14 and base 12, respectfully, and outline a substantially cylindrical label area 24 on the sidewall 14. Thus, a label (not shown) can be attached to, and extend completely around, the container sidewall 14. In addition, preferably the sidewall 14 has a series of circumferential grooves 26 which reinforce the cylindrical shape of the sidewall 14 and resist paneling, dents and other unwanted deformation of the sidewall 14.The container 10 is multi-functional since it can be utilized in hot-fill as well as pasteurization/retort processing. To accomplish this objective, the base 12 has a structure which is capable of accommodating elevated internal container pressure experienced during pasteurization/retort processing and which is capable of accommodating reduced container volume experienced upon cool down of a filled and sealed container after hot-fill or pasteurization/retort processing. To this end, the base 12 flexes downwardly in a controlled manner and to a desired extent when pressure within the filled and sealed container is elevated, and the base 12 flexes upwardly in a controlled manner and to a desired extent when a vacuum develops within the filled and sealed container.Structurally, the base 12 includes a discontinuous concave outer annular wall 28 which provides a plurality of spaced-apart, arcuate supports 30 adjacent the outer periphery 32 of the base 12. As illustrated, four supports 30 are utilized in the preferred embodiment; however, three, five or more supports 30 could also be utilized. Each support 30 has an outer wall portion 34 which extends upwardly toward the lower label bumper 22 and an inner wall portion 36 which extends upwardly and inwardly into the remaining base structure as will be discussed. A standing surface 38 is formed at the juncture of each outer and inner wall portions, 34 and 36, thereby forming a discontinuous support ring of the container 10.An inner annular wall 40 extends within the discontinuous concave outer annular wall 28 and is preferably slightly inclined relative to the horizontal. Preferably, the inclined inner annular wall 40 extends upwardly and inwardly at an angle “A” relative to the horizontal as it extends from its outer periphery 42 to its inner periphery 44. For example, the inner annular wall 40 can incline at an angle “A” in a range of about 5° to about 6° relative to a horizontal plane “P” extending through the standing surfaces 38. Alternatively, the inner annular wall 40 can be formed substantially planar and parallel to a horizontal plane “P” extending through the standing surfaces 38.The outer periphery 42 of the inner annular wall 40 merges with the inner wall portion 36 of each of the supports 30 and with a plurality of spaced-apart, horizontally-disposed, radial webs 46 located adjacent the outer periphery 32 of the base 12. Each of the webs 46 extends between the supports 30 and connects to the container sidewall 14 at an elevation above the horizontal plane “P” extending through the standing surfaces 38. The inner periphery 44 of the inner annular wall 40 merges into an anti-inverting dome 48 which projects upwardly into the container 10. Preferably, the inner annular wall 40 and anti-inverting dome 48 merge via an annular hinge 50. As illustrated in FIG. 13, the anti-inverting dome 48 has a conical lower portion 52 adjacent hinge 50 and a convex upper portion 54.The inner annular wall 40 functions as a flex panel. To this end, when the internal pressure increases within a filled and sealed container, the inner annular wall 40 flexes downwardly as shown in dashed lines “B” in FIG. 13 to accommodate the increased pressure and prevent the sidewall 14 of the container 10 from undergoing unwanted permanent distortion. In addition, the inner annular wall 40 flexes upwardly to relieve vacuum when the contents of a hot filled and capped container, or a filled, capped and subsequently pasteurized container, cool to ambient. This is shown in dashed lines “C” in FIG. 13. Thus, when the sealed container and contents cool to ambient, the sidewall 14 is substantially cylindrical and unchanged from its as-formed shape and is capable of neatly supporting a wrap-around label without unwanted voids or the like beneath the label. In addition, the sidewall 14 resists ovalization and the base 12 provides a level seating surface which is not subject to rocking or the like.The anti-inverting dome 48, the supports 30 and the radial webs 46 support the inner annular wall 40 and permit it to flex only within a desired range of movement as illustrated by dashed lines “B” and “C”. For instance, the inner annular wall 40 flexes downwardly due to an increase in pressure within the container, but is prevented from complete inversion and failure by the anti-inverting dome 48 which travels with the inner annular wall 40 but substantially maintains a constant shape regardless of the internal pressure experienced within the container.Another feature of the base 12 of the present invention is that each inner wall portion 36 of the arcuate supports 30 has an arcuate shoulder, or support ridge, 56 formed therein and spaced in elevation from both the support surfaces 38 and the inner annular wall 40 to facilitate vertical stacking of like containers 10. For example, as illustrated FIG. 14, an upper container 10a is stacked on a lower container 10b. The support ridge 56 in the base 12a of the upper container 10a seats on the outer edge 58 of the upper surface 60 of the lid 62 of the lower container 10b such that the horizontal plane “Pa” extending through the standing surfaces 38a of the upper container 10a extends a spaced distance beneath the top surface 60 of the lid 62 of the lower container 10b. By way of example, and not by way of limitation, the container 10 according to the present invention preferably has a height “H” of about 5.8 inches, a container outermost diameter “D” of about 4.2 inches, and contain a capacity of about 32 fluid ounces. The discontinuous standing ring formed by the standing surfaces 38 has a diameter of about 3.6 inches, and the inner annular wall 40 of the base 12 has an inner periphery 44 with a diameter of about 1.6 inches and an outer periphery 42 with a diameter of about 2.2 inches. The radial webs 46 are uniformly spaced apart and separate each support 30 such that each support 30 is at least about 0.8 radians. In addition, each support 30 has a slightly larger arcuate extent than that of each radial web 46.Preferably, the container 10 is blow molded from an injection molded preform made of PET, PEN or blends thereof or is extrusion blow molded of PP. In addition, the container 10 may be multilayered including a layer of gas barrier material or a layer of scrap material. Preferably, the finish 16 of the container is threaded, blow molded, and severed from an accommodation feature formed thereabove.The above described container 10 is capable of use in hot-fill operations having fill temperatures up to 205° F. It can also be utilized in pasteurization processes wherein a cold solid product, such as pickles, is combined within the container 10 with mildly heated brine at 120 to 140° F. After the container 10 is capped, the filled container can be processed through a pasteurization tank where temperatures approach about 212° F. so that the solid products in the sealed container are heated to approximately 175° F. for 15 minutes before the filled and sealed container is cooled to ambient temperature.While preferred containers and base structures have been described in detail, various modifications, alterations and changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims.1.
